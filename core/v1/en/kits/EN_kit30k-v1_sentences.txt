I don't think Jack wants to see you.
I know that William isn't a university student.
I thought that I might be coming down with a cold.
You don't have to say that.
Don't faint!
I'm telling the truth.
There is a school down the mountain.
I'd like to come with you.
It's been a year since I've been here.
We always have a good time in the morning.
I'll figure out a way to fix this. Don't worry.
Please tell William what you think should be done.
You are in love with him.
They could change their minds.
Adam and Catherine said they thought that it would be a huge mistake to tell John about what had happened.
They found the room empty.
I'm not a bachelor anymore.
We were planning on going.
I'm just telling you what I've heard.
George doesn't like to be the last one to do that.
Jami is the most laid back person I know.
William thought that Margaret would probably do that.
How about with you?
Don't you want to know why I'm here?
Muhammad and Valentina are going to get into trouble if they do that.
I am not coming back to school any more.
I think that that's a very stupid argument.
Do you have any thoughts on my paper?
Alice didn't seem surprised when I told her Adam didn't need to do that.
He admitted that he wasn't perfect.
I don't think I'll be able to talk James into doing that.
I need to get them home.
Why did you break up with your last girlfriend?
If your tooth hurts, you should see a dentist.
We'll be happy to welcome you on Friday.
I'm just about to head off to the station.
Why haven't you asked for my help?
My father is not as old as he looks.
Tommy was the only one here when that happened.
Where to go and what to see were my primary concerns.
I'm sure his brother is very young.
Why do you like this song?
Oscar looks older than his younger brother.
Oscar could be unconscious.
At what age did you get your first period?
Jacob found a good job near his house.
I knew I'd find you.
Where is the hammer?
Try and come up with a more reasonable excuse next time.
I'm in your debt.
George certainly knew what he was doing was illegal.
We can now die in peace.
They were very pretty.
Oscar told Anna a racist joke.
I was kept awake all night by the noise.
Don't forget to ask Harry to do that.
The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know.
What does she want?
Adam wasn't willing to pay such a high price.
Jacob got very violent.
You're having me on, aren't you?
I don't think that would be such a good idea.
We should be there in about thirty minutes.
James isn't responsible for anything.
Muhammad showed up at the party wearing a suit and tie.
I suspect George and Emma are planning to be there.
She has no shame.
A fan page is always public.
Adam's mother lives in Boston. His father lives in Chicago.
A fire broke out in my neighborhood last night.
Urgent business kept him from coming.
Monica is a quiet person, isn't she?
It's clear that he's at home.
It's not cheap to eat here.
There's really no need to apologize.
What have you bought her for Christmas?
I know how you can find out.
Joe didn't know that Mary was John's cousin.
Please don't call us again.
Why do you care what other people think?
Is he in favor of the plan?
Oscar might be the murderer.
We can't just give up on Joe.
He wants to read this book.
Confidence is hard to build, but easy to destroy.
I sold it for 600 euros.
Drink a cup of water.
He is considered to be a highly qualified employee.
Eva is William's aunt.
Aren't you afraid?
I thought his opinion was relevant.
Susie is shallow, isn't she?
They forgot to sign their names.
Which do you like better, physics or chemistry?
I don't ever go swimming with George anymore.
George wasn't the first one to leave.
What's new this year?
I can't do anything about it.
All of these are mine.
Didn't you win the bet?
Why don't people like Oliver?
I think that William didn't know that Margaret spoke French.
Did you tell her you were joking?
William is still on the team.
Tommy is going to be needing this.
Oliver told Alice she should eat everything on her plate.
They weren't strong enough to help us.
Why would Alex refuse to do that?
I still don't like to driving the city.
Harry wasn't very strong.
Alex forgot where he put his glasses.
They set up their backs against the claim.
It's a big deal to Oscar.
I'll tell you about my father.
William ran to help Lucy.
Please hold the door open for me.
You're better off not getting in his way!
We have to get something to eat.
I don't think that Oliver wants to do that anymore.
They told me that they weren't impressed.
You can have as much time as you need.
I know Jack would like to be finished doing that before Monday evening.
It's not an evil idea, but it is a bad one.
People are stupid.
This medicine tastes horrible.
Why don't you two shut up?
Harry might not make it in time.
I need to know if you'll be there.
Harry hasn't seen Anna since Valentine's Day.
I thought that it was fun.
I'm often only half awake.
I didn't want to talk to the police.
How did you know that Muhammad wanted to do that?
I haven't been feeling great.
It was interesting.
How many days will it take to do that?
Who believes that?
They're in their rooms now.
Dan tried to persuade Linda to steal the money.
George was hoping he wouldn't have to do that.
That's something we should do this week.
I gave the milk to the cat.
Button up your coat.
They said they won't ever do that.
I have to pick my kids up at their school.
You should be done doing that by now.
Oscar wakes up when it is already quite light.
She left her glasses in her car.
Even if you boss attacks you and tells you to go away, you should make your point.
This book is way more interesting than that one.
Oliver said that Lucy knew he might be required to do that by himself.
I think she is sick. She has a temperature.
I do want to be your friend.
Can I have a glass of water, please?
So what time do you get off work?
I didn't think Anna really did what Oliver said she did.
What age was she when she got married?
Alex is leaving Boston next month.
I knew Alex was very unlikely to be able to do that.
I suspect that Jack is the one who stole the money.
They like all of their teachers.
I'll be in Australia about a month or so.
I will introduce my father.
I'm really, really proud of you.
No more than 50 people came.
Alex and Valentina have been told they can't do that.
You need to get here as soon as you can.
Jami isn't ready to go anywhere.
Some of my friends smoke.
I was surprised when Oliver told me that he didn't want to do that.
I am ashamed of my president.
There's not much time left.
They'll get hurt if they aren't careful.
What does Monica think about it?
Someone called Jacob.
Mary helped because she wanted to.
I have to do a little research.
Ask William to bring Eva tomorrow.
Did you show them your pictures?
Why did Adam need to go?
Monica said she'd come to the wedding.
Alex was home on Monday.
Can't you see that Alex needs your help?
William said Julia didn't have anything she needed to do.
I tried to talk to them.
In Japan, it's three in the morning now.
I was born on October 20, 2013 in Boston.
I read a lot.
Eva gave Jacob the book she was holding.
James told Margaret that he thought you could do that.
I don't think that I like what you're doing.
If you did not want to do this, then why did you do it? Did someone force you to do this?
The house looked wonderful with its fresh coat of paint.
Oscar is a well-mannered young man.
I thought I told you to stop doing that.
Would you tell us what happened?
What did you tell them for?
They held out against all odds.
Joe and Monica knew they'd been tricked.
She cannot be here so early.
I'm fairly certain that that's not the case.
You're the woman of my dreams.
You're gonna be a dead man if you don't do that.
I'm worthless.
How do you make your money?
I think this is the reason why you don't like me so much.
If you're going to go to France, you should brush up on your French.
I didn't have any money and couldn't buy any food.
They can join us if they want.
Eat your soup, William.
I have no right over you.
We haven't agreed to anything yet.
Oscar got in the car and started the engine.
I'm pretty sure Alex and Susie are having a party next week.
I think that Harry won't be nervous doing that.
Honestly, what time do you plan to sleep until? It's already noon!
Jack needs someone to speak with.
I put gas in the car.
How does he know?
I woke them up.
Can I leave?
I'm reading the Bible for the first time.
Charlie seemed quite surprised when he heard that Alice and John had gotten married.
Please heat the water.
I don't like Jack very much, to be honest.
Muhammad and Emma told John that they didn't think Alice was done doing that.
You're not going to like what I'm going to say.
Don't you want me to do that?
I thought Oscar would go on a road trip.
He looked so funny that I couldn't help laughing.
Are you getting enough oxygen?
I lit the fire.
Muhammad is convinced that Margaret is guilty.
At the start of every weekend, I am both tired and happy.
"Has the sun come up yet." "Yes, it just came up."
Why did you need to go there yesterday?
If I could, I'dÂ do that again.
His father passed away last night in the hospital.
Joe doesn't want to eat.
Jami and Mary said they could see ghosts.
Joe thinks he knows who really did that.
My friend talks too much and she's driving me crazy.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
The wind was blowing.
You're under investigation.
Please don't think of it that way.
Were you hurt?
We've been waiting for this.
She fell unconscious to the floor.
This is the first time I've ever parked my car in the woods.
Jami said that he hoped that Lucy would be willing to do that for him.
It's often said the best way to learn a foreign language is to learn from a native speaker.
What's that guy's name?
We were walking on dead soldiers. This is the worst sight that a man ever wants to see.
Alex and Valentina said they're studying to be doctors.
It is not enough to succeed. Others must fail.
Business is looking up.
He didn't say who he'd gone with.
Are these your gloves?
Oliver never used to win at tic-tac-toe.
But something has gone wrong.
Adam claimed that it was an accident.
I suspect James is likely to be late.
There is a statue of the teacher in front of the school.
We'll just have to do our best.
Muhammad won't be at work tomorrow.
The plane disappeared into the forest.
I didn't say anything wrong.
Have you heard the term Neo-Victorian?
Charlie counted his money.
Don't you take that tone of voice with me, young lady!
You're so kind.
Love one another, as I have loved you.
I'm very determined to get this done today.
I didn't think that Jacob would wait very long.
They let me know that they'd done that.
When I got to school, the race had already finished.
She said she's been forgiven.
It looks like Jami is awake.
Oscar sometimes help me with my math homework.
They jumped up from their chairs.
Show yourself.
That's against the contract.
It's too quiet in here.
We were glad to hear that he got back safely.
How do they want to receive their money?
Tommy showed up late to practice.
I think he is intelligent because he is learning German.
Alex and Margaret still have a lot of things they need to do.
My children are sitting at the table.
Jack isn't sure Olivia didn't know how to drive a car.
Harry told me he didn't kiss Monica.
Oliver and Mary will be leaving for Australia early tomorrow morning.
Couldn't Harry do that?
I don't always do what I'm supposed to do, but I try to.
Come and have some.
What is the role of the University in the modern society?
Harry didn't need to help us, but he did.
She's enjoying herself, isn't she?
If you hear from Jenny, could you tell her I would like to see her?
William and Olivia look like they're tired.
I wonder whether Harry and Valentina were here yesterday.
The sun is rising above the horizon.
Who's going to wear them?
George wasn't willing to give it a try.
Ice is solid.
She said she didn't eat meat.
James promised he'd keep in touch.
Today I'm all out of ideas.
I may just wait until Charlie gets here.
They had no right to do what they did.
I don't have a case for my guitar.
James didn't want to go for a walk.
This pencil is very dark.
Muhammad is living in Australia, isn't he?
It rains in early autumn.
I got tired from all the running around.
Right now, all I want to do is sleep for a few hours.
Sickness changes people.
Muhammad bought Lucy flowers and chocolate.
I'm writing a message to Oscar.
Why did you interfere in an affair that did not concern you at all?
I heard that since Adam isn't feeling well he'll stay home today.
A good beginning makes a good ending.
I'll write a letter to Adam.
It's because she loves me.
I don't think I enjoyed the movie as much as you did.
We're here on vacation.
Did you take note of the telephone number?
I spent all day with Oliver.
You weren't very nice.
You look a bit tense.
Where were we?
Tommy seemed to know Monica didn't do what she was supposed to do.
I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend.
I'm not sure what George wants.
Tommy lives with his aunt.
James and Monica said they wanted us to be here by 2:30 on Monday.
Is it close to the capital?
It has been a long time since we have been this happy.
You'll be all right.
I thought you said that Alex was a jerk.
I wanted to run home.
Where is the nearest shop?
Do you think they'd hire me?
There were no children in the park.
Why are you asking me about this?
Tommy needs to get ready for dinner.
Charlie said his life was in danger.
Alex said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
He always has a smile on his face.
I wanted to stay in Australia a couple of extra days.
Muhammad doesn't seem very hungry.
What we need is help.
Do you know where Oscar lives?
Your cat is hiding from me.
Man will only become better when you make him see what he is like.
I've had no problems with them.
I have a feeling you're going to like Boston.
Jack and Julia didn't tell me they planned on waiting until Monday to do that.
People always seem to want to discuss their problems with me.
Tommy could have been anywhere.
Alcohol is also cheap in Germany.
I'm still running a little bit late.
Do you want fruit juice?
Oscar and Carmen are going to invite John to their party.
Jack was eliminated.
She said she was drunk.
He is in bad health because he walked in the rain.
I'll be able to see him next year.
"Will you be able to do that today?" "I think so."
Harry parked his car in the visitor parking lot.
Oscar and Margaret said they felt fantastic.
I want to go to the cinema.
I'm going to buy some books tomorrow.
Jacob hasn't taken a shower since last Monday.
I don't think that I'm the right person for the job.
He knows how to milk a cow.
I should've been there for Alex.
He went to sleep at six o'clock and he is still sleeping.
I wonder how Oscar feels about that.
Do you think George will like the gift I bought for him?
Jack promised me that tonight he'd sing that new song he wrote.
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.
Are you going to do that by yourself?
I didn't know Oliver was in Boston the same time we were.
I must warn her.
Does Jami still want to come?
A bee flew out of the window.
You're going to eventually be able to do that, aren't you?
I should've known Charlie and Lucy were behind this.
Not all of them are like that.
Would you like to learn to play the guitar?
Oscar should resign.
These must be Alex's.
What's the name of the movie we watched yesterday?
They missed the deadline.
It doesn't hurt as much as it did before.
Why did I have to fall in love with a woman like you?
He dedicated his life to teaching.
She doesn't talk to us anymore.
Sam, no!
I thought that you and Oscar were going to go to Australia.
She does like jazz, doesn't she?
Doing the laundry is my job.
I don't particularly want to do that.
Suppose you had ten million yen, what would you do?
I'll loan you all the money you want.
Joe is the only one who can beat Lucy at chess.
Check George's pulse.
These hats are yours.
We couldn't help laughing at his joke.
No one has time for that sort of thing.
I know that James is planning on doing that.
What's become of Adam?
I'm up to here with him!
Mary is going to get in trouble if she doesn't do that.
What's your sign?
I think Jami has been to Boston at least one time.
There seems to be no possibility of compromise.
Emma's family is happy that she's back home.
She told me I could use her car.
That's why you look so familiar.
You may not be able to do that again.
I think William and Carmen could be teachers if they wanted to be.
I'll give you a call as soon as I know for sure.
I plan to go to Boston whether William wants to go with me or not.
They're not telling me the whole truth.
We get on and off the bus here.
Oliver never has a pencil with him.
Jacob wants me to call Olivia and make it clear that he never wants to see her again.
What he is saying is very important.
I haven't talked to Jack at all.
People have time upon time faced 'a war that must not be lost'.
We could hear the howling of wolves in the distance.
Are you still playing the guitar?
Jack said that Monica wanted him to do that.
There are only a couple of pieces left.
Victory may seem impossible, but actually it is not.
He made his fathers happy.
I assume all our equipment is still up to date.
Joe is almost always busy.
Is there anything you'd like to say to Alex?
I haven't lived in Boston as long as William.
Jami told Mary it was dangerous for her to do that.
Valentina says she didn't know James would do that.
She puts too much sugar in her tea.
Go to him and greet him on my behalf.
I didn't do anything for him.
Jami hired someone to cook for him.
The last time I saw Charlie he was wearing a prison jump suit.
Don't blame the wrong person.
Mary says she thinks she can take care of herself.
Other people at the meeting didn't agree.
Out of every metal, iron is the most useful.
There's a possibility that Charlie will use my bicycle.
You could start your own company.
I should visit Australia, too.
Thank you for your invitation.
Doing that was really hard.
She said she wasn't finished.
There's an American girl who wants to see you.
Susie said she'd be willing to wait until 2:30.
Jacob will spend next weekend doing that.
Charlie has some very important things he needs to do right now.
You don't need to come.
Oscar and Laur are going to take a look at it.
When did you do that?
Look! The train is there!
Did everyone agree with it?
How did Jami and Laur get to know each other?
He hit two birds with one stone.
What made you mad?
That was Alex's last public appearance.
If you turn a blind eye to something, you ignore it.
Tell them I'm sorry.
They had nobody to tell their stories to.
Charlie usually goes to the movies on Friday night.
We're lucky George did that for us.
I thought that Tommy had paid Margaret, but apparently I was wrong.
Jami told me he didn't get it.
This is the hospital which I was born in.
James is going to find his way.
Are you sure you don't want to think about it until tomorrow?
Muhammad tried to forget his love sorrow by playing the piano.
That was wicked of him.
I can't sleep well.
Jack locked all the doors.
James and Catherine went to the harvest festival.
I had completely forgotten.
She may well say so.
Muhammad was holding Anna's hand.
Adam starts work on Monday.
William said that he hopes to be back by October 20th.
We're way ahead of schedule.
William will be here for three more days.
I didn't know I needed to do that by myself.
Muhammad talked about music.
I wanted to talk to James.
I know that I'm supposed to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
I knew that Charlie was in his room reading.
I want to pay back the money I owe.
You're our guests.
I think Jacob is pretty angry.
I still might go to Boston.
I'm always eager.
I took to her the moment I met her.
I can't remember the last time I spoke to William.
Did you go anywhere for the summer?
Charlie said he wouldn't let it happen again.
He adopted the orphan.
I was born in the winter.
William said that he'd be willing to do that tomorrow.
Do you want me to get you a pillow?
Monica probably doesn't yet know she's got to do that today.
I know Joe is a pretty good French speaker.
I still don't remember why.
We'd better go pick up James.
I am in the soup.
I regret losing that opportunity.
Charlie and Alice said they were poor.
She can sing.
What was his name again?
Do you feel all right today?
Tommy is no longer my boss.
I was Jack's French teacher for three years.
The subject is different.
It isn't certain whether Muhammad will do that or not.
I hope I'll get a chance to see you next time I'm in Australia.
Harry told Anna what she needed to do.
What did she put you through?
Don't you tell me what to say.
I hate candy.
Jami says he can help us today.
I'm not convinced that Adam can do that.
This is something that I made for you.
The plane began to climb rapidly.
Do you plan to permit Oliver to do that?
Adam was cut badly.
We've become like brothers.
George didn't tell Eva what she needed to buy.
James walked past me without saying anything.
Alex and Monica told John that they told Alice not to do that.
Charlie says he didn't know Laur was going to have to do that next week.
She said that she'll do that soon.
Do a lot of people live in your town?
Harry has a history of drug abuse.
Have you told Charlie we'll be there?
Oliver looked sharp.
Jacob said he thought that Julia was good at speaking French.
Charlie and Olivia suggested I go with them to Boston.
There goes a wonderful coach over there.
He never explained why he did that.
She says she needs to do that, too.
Harry didn't seem to be in a hurry.
I'm going to ask you to do your duty.
Life will already be over before you know it.
Take care of your clothes.
It sure is hot today.
She has no one to give her advice.
I'm never going to stop loving you.
They have no idea how lucky they are.
You and I aren't like that.
Tommy isn't as strong as I am.
Are you going to break up with me if I get fat again?
The extra room proved very useful when we had visitors.
Rent control limits the rent that a landlord can charge for an apartment.
I won't be there.
I was surprised Jacob wasn't able to do that.
I don't like this sweater.
It's cold outside, so don't forget to wear a hat.
Do you think there's a chance that Charlie is still there?
I enjoy eating with you.
He was my only joy.
We help them in a lot of ways.
French is a difficult language, isn't it?
Charlie pretended that he couldn't understand what was going on.
I haven't changed.
Tommy is staring at us, isn't he?
Adam and I are good friends now, but there was a time when we didn't like each other.
You have to tell William not to do that anymore.
I've finished.
Eva was an attractive girl when she was a teenager.
What did you think of my house?
To stand in your own feet means to be independent.
I'm not totally convinced.
I owe it to my brother that I was able to finish college.
Oscar didn't tell me anything about that.
Oliver and Olivia didn't say anything about where they were going.
Harry says the two of us should sing together.
Carmen wanted to do that this afternoon, but I told her not to.
Oscar is going to eventually get tired of doing that.
You're wrong.
I thought we could do that together.
Are ghosts real?
Was Joe with you?
I haven't yet met Charlie.
Oscar wanted to pay in cash.
It's taken a while.
It took me a long time to reach this decision.
Harry and Julia admitted they do that.
He is in danger of losing his position unless he works harder.
The doctor asked Muhammad what the pain felt like.
What kind of woman do you think I am?
That cake is really tasty!
Joe said that he didn't think Anna did that very often.
I've got a lot of good ideas.
They know what they have done to me.
Alice said she doesn't think Muhammad really knows how to do that.
Why did you leave the class yesterday?
My son has always been very independent.
I will make certain of the situation.
It's going to have to wait until tomorrow.
I don't blame you for that.
He's the cause of all this.
That isn't likely to happen today.
Schools will be closed today because of the snow.
I still can't understand you. Can you turn off the background noise?
He took my umbrella without bothering to ask.
We learn English every day.
Charlie told me that he was planning on leaving his wife.
Muhammad should've let me know earlier.
Tell William it isn't my fault.
Let me go back and get an umbrella.
Which one do you prefer, this one or that one?
I thought I'd left them at home.
I have been as busy as a bee for the past two months.
Is there a check-out on the first floor only?
I don't really want to go to school today.
How many times have I told you?!
Get to sleep.
I don't know exactly what time Alex will be coming.
Where is English spoken?
Adam didn't know what was about to happen.
George doesn't know why Laur left Boston.
I'd rather go to the zoo than to a museum.
My mother always gets up earlier in the morning.
I want you to do that on Monday.
Adam said that Alice really wanted to do that with you.
How many horses do Harry and Eva own?
Did you get anything from William?
It sounds like Muhammad needs to do that.
I don't think that Jack knows anybody here.
The best fish smell when they are three days old.
Jami and Valentina both said that they weren't single.
She used to address me as Joe.
Your name says everything.
William is creative, but Susie isn't.
Itâs not the same to be alone than to be alone in a room that youâve just left.
I don't think Joe and Olivia are blind.
Tommy said he hoped that Valentina didn't have to do that.
Who did Valentina say taught her French?
Those are questions I can't answer.
George told everyone he was retired.
Smile is without cost, but not free.
I don't think Charlie will be able to help us.
Letâs go to the movies!
I know that Oscar is a park ranger.
How old is your bicycle?
Listen to your father, Oliver.
William likes horror movies.
What do you do when you're not studying?
He isn't going to help, is he?
I couldn't get through it.
Tickets are selling fast and space is limited.
I didn't know you had to do that with Adam.
Our school did away with uniforms last year.
We thought the enemy had captured you.
I think that Alex is normal.
I should tell him to try it.
Painting was the great love of his life.
Bill speaks a little Japanese.
Adam is also getting ready.
You want a piece of me? Come on!
She's beautiful and intelligent.
He said that he may not do that.
Alex is likely to walk here.
Does Jack really think we're that stupid?
Who are all these people?
Jack isn't sure he needs to do that.
Oliver cut the pie into six pieces.
I want to lose a few pounds.
The dog seems to be sick.
Tommy took out his cell phone and called for help.
We could share clothes.
I wonder why Alex is so busy today.
Charlie and Valentina wanted to wash their hands.
Women often prefer older men.
Jami and I've just gotten back from Australia.
Now he gets it.
I don't see any reason why I can't go, too.
I really don't know those guys.
I don't want him to get upset.
I'm going to sing.
How long does Tony run every day?
Nobody knew that Jacob wasn't going to be here.
Everybody knows that Oscar was the one who broke the window.
Now I can die happy.
She has denied she cheated.
Charlie is in a coma.
I told him I was just joking.
Arrangements have already been made.
Adam said he was going back home.
James almost never goes to Australia.
It would be a great loss to science if this language were to die.
I'm not racist, but I vote for racist politicians with racist policy plans.
Please play the violin.
I believe Jack can do that.
Don't leave my name out of your list.
I think I'm going to buy myself a cellphone tomorrow.
Jami is a friend of my brother's.
Alex began to read.
She won't apologize.
We have plenty of food.
You trust us, don't you?
Tommy said he would only stay for a few hours.
Joe got really upset.
Jacob is very upset about this.
Where does Jack plan on doing that?
Maybe this'll cheer you up.
He will be back in an hour.
Harry has just been swimming.
Excuse me, Doctor.
What has been your favorite concert of the past 5 years?
Charlie tried to get Olivia to help him do that.
I didn't eat as much as Muhammad did.
Oliver needs to find an apartment near where he works.
Tell us something about yourselves.
Alex should've listened to you and bought that painting when he had the chance.
James said that he wasn't poor.
You can sit wherever you want.
I hope I don't need to do that.
George needs to take a day off.
Let's go to your room.
Why do we have to go anywhere?
Is this where William and Anna live?
Oliver thinks he's pretty good at guitar.
I don't know your address.
Can you guess which cooler is the most efficient?
Muhammad needs to lose some weight.
Harry asked if he could walk me home.
Shouldn't we wait a bit longer?
I didn't know Monica would ask Adam to help her.
I'm tired of him!
I guess that's the smart thing to do.
I spent a lot of time here when I was a kid.
Jami was behind the wheel.
He says he'll do nothing.
Why in the world would George want to do that?
I want to teach today.
Even though he was tired, he worked.
I didn't know Jack could do that so well.
How are you planning to help?
There were police everywhere.
Margaret said she didn't think Jacob did that on purpose.
George was at home when that happened.
You promised William you'd do that.
Adam finally fell asleep.
Our living room is sunny.
They cancelled the festival.
I'm glad I was able to meet you yesterday.
I'll come to Australia and help you build your house.
I think that there's more going on here than meets the eye.
We could not see anyone in the street.
I told William that I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
I hope we're not making a huge mistake.
Emma is a good chess player, isn't she?
There's going to be a press conference tonight.
Who does that remind you of?
I think you need to figure this out on your own.
They stayed at home by themselves.
Harry came to my rescue.
I think we should let Laur do what she wants.
He said that he'll win.
Must I call them before I give it back?
People sometimes do stupid things.
We need help up here.
You've made your bed, now lie in it.
We forgot all about Tommy.
Let's play catch.
I want to get up early tomorrow.
Oscar could've hurt himself.
The book is pink.
Did you receive his invitation?
What did Jacob and Anna do?
Susie is going to be glad she did that.
This road will lead you to the airport.
I have to go now. Bye!
It was a glass that he broke.
I didn't know Jacob knew who was going to do that for you.
You won't believe who I just saw.
Tommy and Catherine were playing tennis this morning.
I don't see it that way.
I cannot say how far his story is true.
Charlie isn't in good shape.
That never would have happened if Joe hadn't shown up.
Harry really thought he should do that.
I guess I was too busy to notice that Jacob and Anna were having problems.
Oliver said that he didn't want to sit with us.
He checked his calendar.
Without George's help, we couldn't have done that.
Jami and Valentina said that they left their keys at home.
Come back in an hour.
Harry has to go back to Boston tomorrow.
You can sit wherever you want to.
He says he will not give up smoking.
I need to see him now.
I got on the elevator.
"Can I make you breakfast sometime?" "Yes, I'd like that very much."
It is good to feel that nothing can come between a man and wife.
Promise me you won't be late.
He used to eat out every day, but now he can't afford it.
Adam has a bus to catch.
My favorite season is summer.
Oliver and Carmen said they like good wine.
She's very happy her team won.
She helped me.
Oliver said that he was willing to wait.
Harry and Monica both died.
I tried on the shirt.
I'd never have allowed Muhammad to do that.
Joe drives a cab.
Jack was kind to everybody.
William and Mary don't like me very much.
Harry and Carmen removed their socks.
The situation has changed.
I wish you'd told me what to expect.
Reputation is what you seem; character is what you are.
I got the short straw.
When he was here, he would swim in the morning.
Alex seemed to be enjoying his life.
I thought you expected me to do that.
Tension is a major cause of heart disease.
She doesn't like football.
George is waiting for a cab.
Adam and Mary pretended that they didn't know me.
Charlie and Alice have a car, but they don't drive it very often.
I have to go find my girlfriend.
He cried for joy.
We need to discuss this further.
Harry and Catherine married when they were young.
I hope it'll be all right.
Alex wasn't paying attention in class today.
They come here occasionally.
Muhammad waited for us at the bus stop.
Joe said he thought that would never happen.
She has too much time on her hands.
Jami thinks he should study French.
I have no desire to go there.
He abused my trust.
It's unlikely Harry will know what to do.
This is definitely the best method.
I'll do everything I can.
I think both George and Laur are shy.
Adam is a great player.
Joe told me he didn't need my help.
Emma said she'd never seen it.
I don't think Oscar will be suspicious.
We have to escape this place.
Oliver is probably still downstairs.
I know Jacob would do that for you if you asked him to.
I don't understand how you can say that.
Whenever you're in trouble or feeling down, I'll be there for you.
I'm the one who caught George.
It's going to be hard for Jacob to do that.
I'm glad that your team won the game.
She is in a bad mood.
Nobody had ever done this before.
I couldn't make sense of most of it.
We're still waiting for him.
I suggested that we should start at once.
You can come with me.
Harry made me wait.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I never should have left you.
Emma is likely going to be very hungry when she gets home.
How many times are you going to bring that up?
Jacob and Margaret will do that if you pay them.
Art is a serious thing.
Jacob is one of my better students.
Is your house far from your company?
Alex doesn't want to buy a new car.
That's why I'm here today.
Before I got married I had six theories about bringing up children; now I have six children and no theories.
I'd like to see you hanged.
Jami and Alice don't know John, but they'd like to meet him.
Who has the key to this lock?
I want you to join us.
Joe assumed that everyone knew that he couldn't do that.
I will never forget you.
Do you think you'd be quiet doing that?
I think I'd hate doing that.
Yesterday I helped my father.
I'm always up this early.
I wish you the best in your next job.
Oscar wasn't paying attention to Anna.
Julia was there, but she didn't help us.
Neither William nor Susie works in Boston.
Do you sing in the choir?
He said that he needed a favor.
I can barely pay my rent.
Susie said that she got out of the way.
Muhammad says he does that.
Why exactly did you need to do that?
I hope that won't happen again.
No one else is coming to look for you.
The rumor disappeared right away.
He told me he was suspicious.
Alice said she had a hard time doing that.
Alex said that he wants to sell his house.
Oscar tied his shoes.
I gave that order six hours ago.
They were never to return to their country.
Do your best for Tommy.
I should've warned you.
"Any good news in today's paper?" "No, nothing in particular."
I'm taking my daughter to Boston with me.
Let him go his own way.
Catherine said she was terrified of snakes.
I just hope nothing goes wrong this time.
I want Tommy to know that I didn't mean for this to happen.
Charlie, you can't be serious?
That's worth considering.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
James plays the piano better than I do.
We plan to visit Jack tomorrow.
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.
Anna said she was glad she'd done that.
Are you the author of this book?
I don't know whether Joe and Catherine intend to do that or not.
I didn't expect to see you here tonight.
I think that I'm going to stay here for a while.
Ask Adam to bring his guitar.
I've met someone.
There's nowhere to run.
Both of my ex-wives hate me.
I was afraid you wouldn't remember me.
Don't you want to sit near the window?
Don't be cruel.
I've put on a lot of weight since Christmas.
No, until now she has never fallen in love.
This dress fits you well.
They said they felt very guilty.
I'm not able to do that on my own.
They look like they're busy.
Please type your name.
I hope you agree with this translation.
I finally have enough money to buy the kind of car I've always wanted.
I don't want to be alone all my life.
Sooner or later, your luck will run out.
She promised that she would help us.
Empty the purse into this bag.
Alex said he found something under the couch.
Let me stay with you.
Today is Monday, October 20th.
Alice is very sure she should do that.
Do you still go bowling as often as you used to?
You still don't get it, do you?
Is your hair still wet?
William says Carmen is afraid to do that.
How does one define life?
I touched his hard penis.
George wants to meet with me.
Charlie said that he bought that for you.
I bought a bus ticket.
She says she plans to take pictures.
William didn't seem to agree.
William said he knew that Mary might not want to do that on October 20th.
Alex's house is next to my house.
Yesterday, Tommy was with me.
Shut the door tight.
Jacob has some pretty good ideas.
I don't think it's George and Catherine who are the problem.
There are many more people than I expected.
Adam says doing that might be dangerous.
Susie told me that she was happy.
Julia doesn't love me anymore.
I think I've got to find some help.
You're so cruel.
We gained access to the house through the window.
Jack's bedroom is much larger than mine.
You're planning to go, aren't you?
I'll get her to stay with you.
Are you ready for the next problem?
We must find it.
They knew they had nothing to lose.
Oscar fixed Julia's car.
I didn't break it.
They were drinking champagne.
Joe looks like he doesn't know what to do.
You should have known it.
I think I'll be able to do that on my own.
I don't think Jacob is going to study French next year.
It gave me a nice feeling.
Jimmy begged me to take him to the zoo.
What would you suggest that I get Joe for his birthday?
I have no idea where I am.
I think James wasn't telling the truth.
Adam is going to find out.
Boston seems to be the place to be.
Jacob will be wrong.
I can't stand noisy children.
I'll come back for my suitcase this afternoon.
Jacob brought everyone together.
What good was that?
Don't forget to remind me of that.
However, we can be people of the earth.
I finally found the solution to the problem.
He spent a few months wandering around Europe.
Oscar said his team would win.
A funny thing happened to me on the way here today.
I saw you kissing James.
We know Olivia will do whatever we tell her to do.
I had a shower.
William and Margaret didn't realize they had to do that.
Let's continue with the lesson for today.
Tommy might not be crying.
I hope that this will help us.
It isn't a permanent solution.
Oscar had all of his suits made to order.
Where did Charlie get the eggs?
I want everybody to know that I'm not the one who did that.
Jami asked some questions to the teacher.
This movie sucks.
Jacob wasn't right about that.
Oscar went in place of me.
Eva will be upset if she doesn't win.
I just found out Jami did the same thing Mary did.
Jack and I don't kiss each other anymore.
Personality is important, but looks are important as well.
Jack has been telling everyone what to do.
He wants to pay back the money he owes.
My job kept me busy.
I was asleep when Charlie dropped by.
There is another killer out there.
Charlie didn't say a word to us.
Don't look directly at Jami.
Mary isn't really sick; she's just pretending.
Yes, I have student ID.
Please allow me to escort you.
How could I know anything about your daughter?
I'm taking Charlie home.
I know Jacob and Monica aren't busy.
Joe would do whatever you ask him to do.
Did you get another cat?
James should've given Julia flowers or something on Valentine's Day.
I don't think Joe is good enough for Lucy.
The boy visits his grandma.
Count your blessings, not your problems.
I can't sleep through the night.
Alex said he's glad that Monica didn't win.
Charlie never got over Olivia.
William married a woman he met in Boston.
You were right, too.
We happened to meet at the station.
I think Adam has already done that.
George has made up his mind.
Oscar described the scenes.
I read it in some book.
It might rain today in the afternoon.
My husband is a very good cook.
Tommy and Carmen seem to be close friends.
The apples are delicious.
Winter sports are very popular in our country.
I don't think Adam knows when Anna came to Australia.
I went to the boss in hopes of getting a raise.
No, not this one!
I like my steak medium rare.
There's nowhere for us to hide.
Jack said Anna would likely complain.
I've already agreed to do that.
Oscar probably doesn't know who I am.
Harry didn't seem to have very much money.
I take it very seriously.
What's the matter? Where have you hurt yourself?
Oscar said that he was very hungry.
He was considered very qualified for the job.
I thought you said that Alex could win.
Valentina told Tommy that she didn't think John was lonely.
Is the party over?
I had a small dog when I was small.
Jack returned to Boston in 2013.
Mum is home.
I will love you forever.
Valentina wore a loose, long-sleeved t-shirt and stone-washed designer jeans.
Is there any help available?
She told me that she's alone.
Maria is in Boston.
Please tell Oliver to call me back.
I already know that Alex doesn't like me.
Is someone coming to pick us up?
Adam told me he'd never done that before.
The light suddenly went out.
You know very well what I mean.
Aren't you angry?
There isn't anything Oliver isn't afraid of.
It is true that they talk a lot, but they say little.
She can't explain what happened.
Alex might be shy.
Jack knew Margaret wouldn't be able to do that.
You have three cars, don't you?
What time do you have a nap?
He fixed his eyes on the roof.
I doubt that Harry will want to go to Boston with you.
Take it.
I want to see results.
Jack was at school last year.
"What's the catch?" "There's no catch. I swear."
Joe said he had failed us.
Say hello to your sister for me.
We threw it away.
I'll wear a white dress.
Mail service in that country is not quick.
Muhammad is going to jail.
At least we know that Alex is alive.
What game are you all playing?
What do you want me to do?
James knew I was sleepy.
I didn't go out because it was very cold.
We spread ourselves out on the lawn.
That's a good picture of James.
I want you to help her.
She said she didn't know why.
I know that Harry didn't know that I couldn't do that.
Dark energy is even more mysterious than dark matter.
Jami had never seen the man before in his life.
In the future, cars will drive themselves.
Do you three ever go to Australia together?
Mary said that she was no different.
James used to play soccer.
Jackson is my last name, not my first name.
No questions! Just listen to me, OK?
I identify with you.
Alice cooked dinner last night.
I wish to speak to the manager.
I'm tired but I'll do it anyway.
I love watching TV.
I thought that Oscar would tell me how to do that.
Now, what were we talking about?
I'm not sure that I would recognize James.
The artist belongs to his work, not the work to the artist.
Do you want to get a pizza?
That isn't too bad.
They like fruit.
I'll meet them some other time.
Who doesn't want to win?
The teacher caught the student cheating on the examination.
Why were Charlie and Eva there alone?
My advice would be to stop doing that.
I bought myself a warm pair of gloves.
We should start getting Christmas gifts for the children.
He had fallen in love with her.
Julia doesn't study as hard as she used to.
I want to speak with them now.
Muhammad and Mary told me they'd never leave me.
I didn't think that we should wait.
Haven't I told you this before?
How'd it work out?
I'm going to think about it.
I know Muhammad will love it.
George doesn't go to Boston anymore.
He said he had to leave early.
How many accounts do you have?
I am not interested in sports.
I will keep nothing back from you.
Jacob told me he wasn't upset.
She's making progress in cooking.
I think that Adam should do that himself.
Joe and Valentina told me they were strong.
You're embarrassing yourself.
Jami didn't like living in the country.
Muhammad figured it would take him a full day to finish painting the garage.
An ambulance went to the scene of the accident.
He tried to get rid of the ants.
Jack and Lucy said they would've done that if they'd known they had to.
Copy. I read you. Over and out.
Why don't we flip a coin?
Pay off your credit cards every month.
I think Alex didn't have to do that alone.
Honey is made by bees.
James didn't seem to be as young as Laur seemed to be.
She'd been with the same company such a long time, she felt she needed a change of scene.
He has already had lunch.
Does Harry live in Australia?
Is this holding us back?
Muhammad did an awesome job.
Thank you for inviting me to your birthday party.
I have to buy this medicine.
Joe wanted to know what was happening.
Without your help I would have had no success.
I'm very glad that I didn't do that.
I think they've done a good job.
Alex is Susie's youngest son.
Adam might not come back.
How long does it take to get to Boston by plane?
Jami isn't fat.
Alex said it was him who should do that.
Harry told me he thought Margaret was broke.
I wish you had done what I asked you to do.
When Adam finally decided to come out of the closet, everyone already knew he was gay.
How would you help?
George won't like this.
Do I need to add salt?
I see I was right.
She doesn't smoke and she doesn't drink vodka.
Joe's hands slipped around Monica's waist.
It is natural that he should refuse that request.
Do you have time for me?
Let Eva read whatever she wants.
I know Jacob is the one who's supposed to tell Anna she should do that.
You didn't mention that on the phone.
James called his ex-girlfriend and asked her whether she'd consider getting back together.
What would you advise, Oscar?
Julia thought she might not need to do that by herself.
They can't tell us what to do.
He had the privilege of studying abroad for two years.
I thought that Tommy would like to know.
Do this work by tomorrow if at all possible.
I won.
It's an Indian dish.
I could not but talk back to my boss.
How about a good massage?
Did you tell James about the fire?
That changes nothing.
You really do speak English quite well.
Harry said he probably wouldn't be busy on Monday.
I think that because he is a blunt person, many people do not like him.
Emma wants us to know that she was the one who did that.
He is working for social welfare.
I didn't realize you didn't know how to speak French.
Here's how I see it.
It is never too late to be what you could have been.
Oscar has been to Boston three times.
Jacob says that I always talk about myself.
How long have they been walking?
I think I read that somewhere.
He can stay here for one night, no longer.
He admitted he was lonely.
Do you have any idea why George would want to do that?
I want you to come to my birthday party.
Have you asked anybody to feed your dog while you're in Boston?
Joe couldn't remember where he hid the money.
Muhammad believes he can win.
Adam doesn't have much to gain either.
I just don't want to let Jacob down.
Does Jami know that you want to do that before 2:30?
We'll get an opportunity to do this again, I think.
Alex said that he enjoyed his time in Australia.
Jacob caught on pretty quickly.
She looked after the children.
Don't pretend you don't know.
Jacob is a stubborn person, isn't he?
They told everyone they were exhausted.
Weren't Oscar and Monica just in Boston last week?
Please ask Jack to wait in his office.
Will it be a difficult exam?
Last night, we heard sounds of gunshots and screaming on the street outside our window.
I know that Oliver isn't a good student.
Oscar will be in Boston next Monday.
He says he has to do that.
It won't take so long.
I don't think that that's the whole story.
We must deal with this problem.
I wish William hadn't told Olivia I'd been in prison.
Harry could do nothing.
Very few people actually do that anymore.
You should sound him out about the matter.
It's a beautiful day.
What kind of clothes should I pack?
James read the note.
Oscar liked that idea.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
Exercise is good for your health.
How do you come to that conclusion?
I don't think people use that word anymore.
Find mutual interests, and you will get along with each other.
Her hair is black in color and long.
I have no more than ten English books.
He wrote the story about the things that happened before he lived.
Can you explain this to me?
How often does Tommy go to school?
I think that Tommy has never done that.
Jack is going to be ready in a few minutes.
I'm really starting to get worried.
The potential is there.
If your answer is correct, it follows that mine is wrong.
Adam said that Susie seemed to be busy.
I was badly in need of his help at that time.
The young man knows little of his own country.
What do you do when you visit Australia?
Alex and Mary aren't going to talk to you.
There's only one bath towel in our bathroom.
George will do what Anna tells him to do.
You know, I had a lot of fun.
I like dogs, too.
Susie says she doesn't believe Oscar really did that.
She turned her back on Tommy.
We don't know yet if he really broke his leg. They'll do an X-ray of it.
I asked Susie if she needed more time.
Dad, will you please let me borrow the car?
Harry is going to find out who did that.
I'm sorry for ruining your birthday party.
The building fell down.
I just wanted to call you and let you know I'd be late.
Margaret says everyone she knows can swim.
Two young boys are carrying a load of water on a pole.
None of his advice was very useful.
Please make sure that doesn't ever happen again.
I know Joe can't stop me from doing that.
Why do you want to do that now?
I hope that's enough.
She put her wedding ring back on.
Oliver wasn't rich back then.
Not only was Alex a good friend of the family, he has also become pretty much a father figure to Mary's kids.
Like I said, I didn't do that.
Jacob didn't think Valentina was depressed.
That was interesting.
I've been doing that for Harry for quite a few years.
I hate Halloween.
They insisted on my making use of the opportunity.
Tell her to help me.
Don't thank me!
They turned a TV set on.
She has been lying, hasn't she?
Joe looks real worried.
She has painted the door red.
I want to see it.
This is a very useful book.
The event is on Friday.
I don't want you anymore.
We're all in this together.
These are difficult questions.
I thought that you'd be in Boston by now.
Jami felt Emma wasn't being sincere.
George says he thinks Valentina did that.
I could not sleep because of the heat.
I don't think I've ever seen you this happy before.
He prepared supper by himself.
Life's not fair.
The doctor said that there's nothing wrong with you.
I used to like you a lot.
This is their place.
She said she was finished doing that.
The trip cost me a lot.
Why do they do that?
He did what we wanted him to do.
You know how to explain it, don't you?
Muhammad said that you were in Australia.
I prefer going for a walk to seeing the movie.
Did you see anyone on the beach?
It was a great race.
I'm getting tired of waiting.
Do you recommend doing that?
How can I do that?
George was told that he had to do that.
There aren't any roses in the garden.
It's not what I thought.
I wonder if Oscar will enjoy doing that.
Alice is still wearing her police uniform.
She's tired after a long week.
This is my third year.
Maybe George likes someone else.
It's nice meeting you.
You've got some nerve.
I need to remind Oscar to do that.
James and Laur don't want to go to Australia.
No one has the right to tell you that their life is harder than yours.
I'd like to stay as long as possible.
Sometimes it takes more than one person to do this.
He was anxious to meet you.
The time when mankind is free from hunger is yet to come.
He suggested going out to watch a movie.
What's your favorite language?
I hardly understood anything at all.
I didn't think that the pain would ever stop.
He does not work so hard as he used to.
My mother can't attend.
George had better be careful.
Dozens of cars are parked in the parking lot.
Emma says she hopes Harry is willing to do that.
Let's see if Oliver can manage to do that by himself.
James is running a high fever.
Catherine says she has no idea where Joe lives.
George wasn't the only one in the room at 2:30.
Alice doesn't waste time.
I won't be at work tomorrow.
Oliver may not be going to Boston with us.
Keep climbing.
I think that Jack and Susie both have to be told not to do that.
That's what it feels like.
The writer is well known to us.
I know William has decided not to do that.
William and Monica listened to the sounds of the sea.
Tommy is going to come on Monday.
Is there any chance you'll go to the post office today?
We can try again later.
Everyone get up and put your children on your shoulders.
Do I really need anything?
Don't forget to add a little salt.
We should wait a little longer, I think.
I am happy about your good luck.
I have lived here for thirty years.
You knew I was supposed to do that yesterday, didn't you?
The girl still believes in Santa Claus.
Harry is kind to old people.
Adam became a national hero.
Jami and Eva said that they isn't going to do that.
I'm a father of three young kids.
We've done it all.
Can they die?
She hated herself.
If you'd known that I was male, wouldn't you have spoken to me?
He may not drive a vehicle.
Oscar's very neat.
This is how Oliver does it.
Yes, I spoke with the company president.
Joe will continue to wait.
She ate all her meals in her room.
I thought that you said that Jacob wasn't a member of our club.
He went to the garage.
Is he asleep?
All good in the hood?
Just this morning, my wife told me that she was pregnant.
Monica wanted to talk to her lawyer.
Can you think of any reason that George would do that?
I'm going to wait until James gets here.
They know that I talked to you.
The Great Fire of London occurred in 1666.
Muhammad didn't ask for any money.
I know that Alex would hate to do that.
Charlie said he doesn't think Anna really has to do that anymore.
Tell a lie often enough and it will become the truth.
I'm sorry I shot you.
I can't stand that music anymore!
Luckily the door was open.
How can I trust you?
Oscar told Carmen about his family.
I want to go to Tokyo.
Everybody wants to do that.
My alarm went off at 6:30.
I knew Muhammad was afraid that he might hurt Mary's feelings.
I wish you'd tell me what happened.
They tried to hide their tears.
I thought that you were planning to be here earlier.
What are we doing here?
Do you need a ride?
Tommy sat down beside Eva on the bench.
Would you care for another cup of coffee?
Harry finished the dishes.
You warned William you might do that, didn't you?
Life has become easy.
They said that they'd help you do that, too.
What are Oscar and I supposed to do with this money?
Did Joe mention anything to you about my idea?
Tell George I'm not ready.
Adam doesn't know whether what Julia says is true or not.
I suspect that George and Julia are in Australia.
They didn't deny that they did that.
Please measure the length of the mattress.
I also don't think George needs to do that.
I know that you'll be here tomorrow.
Come fishing with me.
I wish I could go to Boston with you.
Is there a problem, sir?
It looks like Adam isn't interested in that.
You don't seem particularly worried.
He says he feels like crying.
How should I change that?
Jacob doesn't think Valentina will like John.
Most people travel by train.
If anyone should phone, say I will be back at one o'clock.
How did you spend your summer holiday?
He was not sure what to do.
Oscar said that he was in love with you.
I'm going to stay in Australia for a few more days.
Her lecture is above my head.
You'll have no problems.
You're a bit shorter than Adam is.
Japanese history is my favorite subject.
How are they going to be better off if taxes go up?
I thought that you said you'd never do that with Adam.
William and Valentina said that they don't like this color.
Adam is supposed to be sleeping.
He told her about his plan.
George was able to solve the problem.
Hello and how are you?
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.
I have a great memory.
Margaret talked James into going to the concert with her.
Susie showed me a picture of her boyfriend.
Oscar gave me several books.
Strange as it may sound, it is still fact.
Everybody's doing well.
I know Alex is sleepy.
She said she has to get more sleep.
I like history.
I don't know if I will have time to do it.
I'm already quite busy.
I have no problem with that.
Jacob once worked for me.
I have to give a testimony in the courtroom tomorrow.
They were crying.
Alex lives in the southern part of Australia.
Jacob set down his cup.
It's really bad for your eyes.
William is waiting for us in the car.
William is strong enough to do that by himself.
You can tell them I said so.
Her hat matches with her shoes.
She was brought up by him.
I don't eat supper because I want to lose some weight.
I was brought up in the country.
Charlie never said that.
We want Oliver to help us tomorrow night.
I know that Oliver isn't still afraid to do that.
"What happened to you, Anna?" asked Jack while carrying the poor crazy woman to the back.
I don't think that this is real.
Laur was afraid to go there by herself.
I've had it with this stupid job.
Mary didn't tell you any of this, did she?
Anna is quite a doll.
There is no thinking without what is called 'association of ideas.'
They said they felt humiliated.
You're a little liar.
Is that what you think I want to hear?
I know Oscar isn't much older than Laur.
William told me you were pretty good at tennis.
At your service, my dear sir!
We continued to talk.
What was there to see?
Valentina is not just cute, she's a real beauty.
I will confirm my plane reservation.
Who told you that?
We didn't take notice of her sorrow.
I need you to come to Australia.
We wanted to keep you informed.
I didn't recognize your voice.
Character is much easier kept than recovered.
Tommy said that doing that would be OK.
Why don't I write in Russian?
Do you think that Harry will come to Australia?
Why should I believe that?
That language sounds ugly.
Muhammad sat down at his desk.
Jack thought that Susie would like John.
Jami and Anna got married two weeks ago.
I tried to get Charlie to help us.
I can't keep my coat on in this heat.
What kinds of changes are needed to address these problems?
It really feels good.
Monica said she's not making a lot of money.
It is as if the whole sky were on fire.
They said that they thought they couldn't win.
Muhammad and Laur thought they'd be able to do that by themselves.
George said that he wished he hadn't asked Margaret to do that.
The radio station came back on the air shortly after the storm.
Can Oscar afford that?
James and Carmen are very close friends.
They told me they wanted to go to Boston.
This job calls for practice.
Jami and Susie said that they feel good.
I should've known something was wrong when Alex and Anna weren't here by 2:30.
Were you ever on television?
What good books these are.
I thought that I'd surprise Oscar.
I am not myself.
William is the head of the laboratory.
James and Monica took the concert tickets John offered them.
There's a cold wind from the north.
They said they were too weak to do that.
He cannot fix his attention on anything for long.
I don't think you need to tell Joe what you're going to do.
We saw another ship far ahead.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
Muhammad and I enjoyed ourselves.
I know Jacob doesn't really want to do that anymore.
I have a pain in my neck.
Is that white car in front of my house William's or yours?
Who is so crazy?
That could buy us some time.
What do you think we should do?
She doesn't want to go to school today.
That wasn't a dream.
I thought Jack might want to go with us.
How did Oscar take it when you told him?
I ran across an old friend near the bank.
Something doesn't feel right.
I have fond memories of all the time we spent together.
James wasn't the one who told Mary that she didn't have do that.
What breed is your dog?
I suppose it's a good thing.
Let me say what I think.
I thought that you said that it was urgent.
I suppose I could help you.
Reading makes me happy.
I've got great news.
How tough is that to handle?
He was elected mayor of Boston.
The question is whether Jami will do it or not.
I would think that Joe would appreciate your help.
No, Sir, I am German.
I'm thinking about ordering another drink.
Why do you say these things, brother?
I didn't want to do anything with Oscar.
Muhammad has put on a lot of weight.
Look at the book which he put on the desk.
You'd better wait until Oscar gets here.
You're dear to me.
If her temperature goes up, send for the doctor.
William didn't convince everyone.
I should run.
Could that be James?
Watch them closely.
I told you we'd meet again.
William might not be able to do that yet.
Adam and Eva will ask John to do that for them, won't they?
Oliver makes good salad.
English is a language spoken throughout the world.
Harry is going out to buy some things.
Did Harry draw this picture by himself?
Do you know them?
I wonder whether William really likes Boston.
That was a special moment.
I did not betray you.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I know that Oliver is a violin teacher.
She always finds fault in everything.
We hired a car for a week when we were in Italy.
I thought that we talked about this already.
We both had to do that again.
Who gets to decide what's offensive?
Can I chat with you outside for a second?
They never told me they loved me.
I've been looking for you all morning.
James walked past.
Can someone explain this?
Adam can help you.
It would probably be impossible to do that by yourself.
I think a lot of people will be there today.
Jami said it should've been easy to do that.
Jack knows what's wrong.
It must have been an accident.
Susie said she knew William might need to do that.
I've already got a place to live.
It is a nice day!
George used to be your best friend, didn't he?
He knows we believe in him.
She certainly looks like she's rich.
You won't be able to help us.
Every child should be able to dress how they like.
He walked away too quickly for me to catch up with him.
Why do we care about what Oscar is going to do?
I don't recall asking you to do that.
The meeting ended at three in the afternoon.
Can you please correct my translation?
How you can be so blind?
His hobby is stamp collecting.
Jami and Alice said that they weren't wrong.
She never knew her parents.
You didn't invite me.
James came here all the way from Australia.
Oscar isn't going to be back until Monday.
He says he believes in ghosts.
Don't lose that.
If the car breaks down, we'll walk.
I don't think George knows who's going to do that with Valentina.
The curtain was up and the performance had started.
Charlie is supposed to be here all afternoon.
Jack and Margaret were both silent for a long time.
William, Anna, John and Alice are all from Boston.
I thought that Joe would be glad to see Margaret.
He read the letter over and over.
Why don't you go on ahead without me?
We want to learn.
Tommy bought his wife everything she wanted.
They want to talk to you a moment.
Tommy isn't someone you should trust.
I love the way the language sounds.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I have no time to go to America.
Alex knocked on the door, but got no response.
Did you come by yourself today?
I have a feeling Catherine won't do what she's promised to do.
I suppose I'd better phone them.
A lot of trees grow in the countryside.
Call the police and tell them what you told me.
You ought to ask for your teacher's permission.
That's not my umbrella.
Have you told Oscar about what happened yesterday at school?
Finding Adam won't be difficult.
Alex doesn't want to do that again.
James is free to do whatever he wants to do.
That horse may be a good bet.
We are not being careful.
It wasn't that cold.
Oliver and Julia promised they'd check on it.
How did you get to be a cop?
I promise I'll never tell her.
Put away your bicycle.
George paid for dinner and left the restaurant.
I understand finally.
You can't just quit.
Joe is going to be very tired when he gets home.
Maybe that's right.
I can't stop looking at Tommy.
If something happens, don't say I didn't warn you.
He just came back from the library.
I am a university student and I want to learn a lot.
Oliver picked his hat off the ground.
I love to travel abroad.
I wonder whether James is really reliable.
Let me see that.
It's got to be now.
I knew that Jack was in the kitchen, cooking.
I saw them tonight.
George isn't looking for sympathy.
You can do whatever you want to do.
Oscar and Lucy didn't think they should do that.
I don't like Adam and he doesn't like me either.
Alex doesn't know French at all.
You may answer the question.
I told Adam he should keep his promise.
This is my opinion.
I thought Joe wasn't as old as Susie.
I went fishing with my brother in the river.
I would love to buy you a drink.
Jack is not a happy boy.
I thought that you said you wanted to be the first one to do that.
It's not likely Jack will do what we ask.
You aren't going to open it, are you?
Is the news good or bad?
She told me she'd do that soon.
I don't think that Jami has any idea where Laur is.
I don't think that Jacob has much money with him.
William is John's older brother.
I didn't know that Oliver wouldn't enjoy doing that by himself.
You have to understand that.
Charlie is in need of a vacation.
The old woman fell and could not get up.
I'll leave this with you.
Which boy did that?
I'm left-handed.
I saw the boxing match on television.
Adam said he never wanted to do that.
How long is your Christmas vacation?
Harry didn't think that Eva would be in Australia this week.
Muhammad was alone on an empty beach.
Do you know how Oscar got that scar on his chin?
I haven't studied that much!
She promised she would be there.
I think my dad would have been pleased.
You should've just told me the truth.
It works the same way in every country. Well, almost.
She passed the examination by working hard.
He can swim.
She told me that she'll be back soon.
James and Laur both lived in Australia when they were children.
Muhammad has already bought what he wants.
Adam and Carmen ended 30 years of marriage.
He's washing his car right now.
Heat up a little milk for breakfast.
It's just a scratch.
Alex is the black sheep of the family.
I'll help Alex with his homework after dinner.
I don't think I need a coat today.
Which movie did you watch last?
I felt that that was too good a chance to miss.
They plan to get married tomorrow.
What a business it is!
Sweet dreams!
Put it on the table.
Thank you for listening.
I'm so sorry that I lied to you.
I should've told them the truth.
I only wish it wasn't so hot today.
You looked like you were drunk.
Jacob is as strong as a bull.
As far as I know, your letter is under that book.
Tommy either wears a gray suit or dark blue suit to work every day.
Harry said he did nothing wrong.
Jacob wanted to scare Laur.
It concerns my brother.
I knew James would be awake.
Try to have fun.
He said he was getting hungry.
That won't happen, certainly not.
They're now on their own.
James bought a house in Australia.
We shall do this free of charge.
I hope it wasn't too much trouble.
My mother never drives for fear of causing an accident.
Why don't I have a boyfriend?
I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry.
You'll probably get hurt if you do that the way Oliver suggested.
Be careful in there.
I'll see you to your car.
They said they didn't need a break.
It was cold last night.
Charlie gave water to his dog.
What was your favorite holiday when you were a child?
I'm afraid that Tommy will be arrested.
"Does it still work?" "Define 'work'."
Monica said she didn't know why Joe wanted to do that.
I don't know if Jami will be doing that or not.
Alex and I almost got married.
There is no time to argue.
There's plenty of coffee.
It is no wonder that he failed.
Charlie eventually wound up in Boston.
Shall we go home?
I want you to come at once.
Are you badly hurt?
I don't think that Oscar is the right person for this job.
Climb up the tree.
I don't think that I'd be able to forgive Jami if he did that to me.
Charlie wouldn't let me do that.
We carried out that plan.
I'd never marry someone like you.
It's very important.
She learned to bicycle over the last year.
Catherine said she wondered why William did that.
I suspect Oliver is worried about that.
James said that he was the very first one to do that.
I'm not helpless, you know.
I'm not on James's side.
All the children went to bed.
I think you know what I want.
George's plane leaves for Boston at 2:30 p.m.
I said hello. Didn't you hear?
I almost forgot to tell Oscar how to do that.
I think you should stop smoking.
She couldn't get the book she wanted.
Let's go to Australia next spring.
I hope my bike doesn't get stolen.
You can say anything you want about me, but don't say anything bad about James.
They ate their dinner.
I imagine you're not the only one, Mr Bark.
The conference is to be held in Tokyo the day after tomorrow.
Changes are alreadyÂ under way.
Dan was promoted at his job.
Does Charlie have a big family?
Will you tell me how to play the guitar?
The noise bothers me.
I wonder why Charlie is glad that that's going to happen.
Would someone else like to eat?
Those two children are the same age.
William didn't seem to be as offended as Eva seemed to be.
We're giving him the apple.
Charlie did warn them.
Harry is cold, but Lucy isn't.
William took a crack at it.
George wasn't the one who told me that you needed to do that.
Many students bought the book.
My friend died from a wound.
The horse is far from the house.
She told you what to do, didn't she?
The color red is beautiful, but it can't beat blue.
I know that Joe can swim better than me.
Jack and Laur said they didn't want to ask John to help them.
William is the one who taught me that song.
Let's do more.
I'm not like them.
The girl did nothing but read all day.
I didn't think that anyone could've stopped Joe.
The thief seemed to break in through a window.
Why do you need matches?
I thought that I heard the door open.
What would you do if this was your last day on Earth?
It doesn't matter when you come.
Harry said he thought that Mary would be willing to do that.
Aren't you going to Muhammad's party?
I'd like to go and see Jack, but what good will it do?
I don't think there should be any problems.
Joe admitted he was a thief.
It's all work-related.
Why do you want to see us?
Jack works as a painter.
Both Jack and Margaret were in shock.
Alex believes that Catherine is lying.
Olivia thinks that she knows best.
William said he'd help me.
Jacob didn't think Valentina heard him.
They say that they plan to do that.
Jacob said that Eva was unable to do that.
I'm sure Jacob won't be frightened.
I was waiting for you to say that.
George and Emma have asked us to help them get ready for tonight's party.
I didn't really think it would happen.
Alex said that he knew the reason why Eva couldn't win.
It is getting worse.
The restaurant is downtown.
Jami will forgive Catherine.
Muhammad wished he'd never met Laur.
She told me that she could take it.
Jacob did not respond to my question.
Who are you to talk to me like that?
Why don't you drive?
I'm not lonely.
Charlie wasn't here earlier, was he?
We know all this already, Oscar.
There were no schools for the deaf at that time.
We're planning to go together.
George and Olivia have told me they can take care of themselves.
I really miss Oliver.
I'm not going to tell her that.
I really need to catch the first train tomorrow morning.
Did you fall from the sky?
You know how to repair computers, don't you?
To buy books would be a good thing if we also could buy the time to read them.
Parents shouldn't let children be cruel to animals.
Don't throw a stone into the river.
We meet sometimes at the shop.
Alex ignored the request.
I think Oscar is determined to do that.
James watched Eva for a moment.
Please mail this letter for me.
Harry and Margaret told me they were feeling bad.
Ken seems to be a friendly person.
George stayed to help Julia clean up.
Oliver is eager to succeed.
Who are they sending?
Dan didn't want to believe that Linda did that.
I don't want to lie to George.
I don't always do this this way.
Oliver is never going to find us.
When will you go?
I give you permission to do whatever it takes to finish the job.
Muhammad didn't let Mary sit next to him.
There was a boy named Johnny, he had a modest look of a lamb.
Will we be in time for the train?
William and Catherine told me they weren't sleepy yet.
I'll put $300 in the bank.
Bill was unable to get Julia to understand what he said.
What color is this cat?
I couldn't think of anything else I needed to do.
Did you know William played the guitar?
She was lying to you the whole time.
We call that color "midnight blue".
The boy all but fell into the river.
Doing that should be possible.
Jami made me get an appointment.
Alex had bigger plans for the future.
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
I will have finished reading this novel by the time you come tomorrow.
I'm not sure Carmen would want Jami to kiss her.
You could do that by phone.
How is it that you're always so full of energy?
My car is in the parking lot behind this building.
I wanted to hurt him.
George didn't realize that we wanted to do that.
Muhammad was able to do that without any help.
Do you know why Muhammad wouldn't do that?
It's super simple!
Tommy hadn't expected it to be like this.
My hands are tied.
They say that they know what they're doing.
I have to pay for it.
I'm getting dressed.
You seem to be a reasonable person.
There aren't many students who can read Latin.
George and Laur said they felt helpless.
I thought that you said that you enjoyed doing that.
Jami is pretty good at drawing.
I do a lot of worrying.
George will help me.
"From what I heard, you practically threw yourself at him." "I don't know what you're talking about."
James said he thought Margaret would be shy.
I hope you know that the last thing that I want to do is go there without your permission.
His passport was stolen.
They arrived at an awkward time.
Jacob seemed to be relieved.
Muhammad thought Julia and I wouldn't enjoy camping by ourselves.
Lucy didn't say when she was planning to leave.
Long live the king!
Why don't you help Jami with that?
I think Alex is still suspicious.
I have another job.
Let's not even worry about that today.
Oliver deserted his wife and family.
I know that Jacob isn't going to win.
Oscar says Margaret can do that.
He said that he spoke French.
I became Charlie's friend.
One moment, please. I'll be right back.
William is furious.
Oliver ended his speech with a joke.
He won the third prize.
That's not likely to happen in my lifetime.
That's a horrible plan.
I couldn't do otherwise.
We may never know who killed Jacob.
Most people don't talk about this stuff.
I got the impression James and Lucy weren't having any fun.
I never thought we'd get here on time.
Where on earth can Muhammad be?
Has anybody been helping you?
I have nothing better to do.
I didn't know that you wanted to work for me.
I didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
I don't think you need to tell Oliver why you didn't do that.
Who are Harry and Mary looking at?
You should come to class on time.
I think maybe Oliver has something else to do.
Monica was a little anxious.
James has something to do right now.
Jacob asked to be driven home.
The two politicians met face to face for the first time.
Can I do that tomorrow?
I know Joe knew Catherine wanted to do that.
You have one minute to defend your point of view.
Oscar and Olivia are just getting to know each other.
What can I get for you?
I don't think Oscar has any friends who do that.
James is a science teacher, isn't he?
Adam didn't know he was doing anything wrong.
He was taught English by a non-native English teacher.
They didn't know what they should say.
I'm not violent.
What are you learning from the teacher?
He has to repair the clock.
Why doesn't she have anything to say?
Jacob's trial is set for next Monday.
My right eye feels hot.
Jack and I didn't go together yesterday.
George made cookies.
Somehow we survived.
Do you think Muhammad will believe you?
William probably doesn't have enough time to do that before he goes home.
I hardly ever go to Boston.
I made him a promise.
When did you find out that Joe couldn't legally drive?
Be careful not to spill your beer.
I'm hoping Alex and Carmen don't show up.
Paris has a great charm for Japanese girls.
Emma lost her entire savings.
She said that she can't do that.
What is it you wanted to tell me?
We were all very hungry.
I know what they're going through.
I don't think that George knows how much time he'll need.
You may be in danger.
Muhammad didn't want to go hunting.
That's always a good sign.
Hard use has worn this bag.
I should never have become a teacher.
Please wait until the end of this month.
Why are you here alone?
Where did she see that happening?
You look so cool.
Oscar did all kinds of things he shouldn't have.
Why's your name not on the list?
George said he'd try.
William has more than enough room for us.
Jami went on a camping trip with a friend.
Oliver was a nice person.
It seems like all we do is work.
Charlie left the house after breakfast.
I was really looking forward to the game.
Eva is still on vacation, isn't she?
The wind remained calm.
I'd like to get together with you before I leave for Europe.
I didn't think Muhammad would actually do that.
Alex works as a waiter.
Be careful with what you say, you fool!
I know James knows that Catherine doesn't have to do that anymore.
I looked at my options very hard.
It's in the trunk.
There was fighting in the streets.
It seemed like Jack might complain.
Oliver isn't his real name.
I worked in this factory.
Jacob hasn't seen Margaret for quite a while.
Both Alex and Valentina lived in Boston.
I think Oliver is nice.
I would say that we have a full belly, right?
I've got some business here.
We might not stay in Boston as long as we had planned to.
Why are they so different?
Muhammad and Valentina are planning to sing together.
I don't think that I'd mind eating Chinese food every day.
He solved every problem.
I don't know what I think.
You cannot put the entire blame on me!
I had a hard day.
William was born in Boston in 2013.
I have the keys.
I'm used to the heat.
Why don't we cancel the party?
I hope Jack and Anna aren't at today's meeting.
You'll be able to do that if you put your mind to it.
Let's go grab a cup of coffee.
Here is her letter asking us to take care of her only son.
I met him by pure chance.
Aren't you still upset about that?
You look just like a guy I used to know.
You have to work harder on your Japanese studies.
Jack said Susie died in her sleep.
Dan is on Linda's side.
It should be OK to do that now.
Julia would just like to know what she did wrong.
The waters of the river ran red with blood.
He's still waiting for her downstairs.
Who else did you tell?
They said their houses weren't locked.
I didn't know who was going to meet me at the airport.
The house Jack built is really nice.
We're all done.
He said that he'd be right back.
I thought this book was interesting.
Did Adam say anything about who was with Margaret?
Most back pain gets better on its own.
I came here as soon as I heard you needed help.
I think William kissed Margaret yesterday.
Large fries, please.
Give me some tea.
Please add a period at the end of your sentence.
I don't need to wear a suit and tie to work.
George told me he's ready to do that.
I'll pay for the drinks.
I haven't cooked the eggs yet.
We're going to rent a car and drive to Boston.
I think that James has been to Boston at least once.
The place was totally deserted.
I thought that Oscar was your cousin.
What's this purple stain?
William said that he wished he'd given flowers to Julia.
What do you love? What don't you love?
I gave Alex an opportunity to do that.
Alex said he didn't want to eat right now.
I knew it would make her happy.
I love going to the beach.
Doing that didn't make George happy.
That's not a coincidence.
She sang better than he.
I was hoping you'd tell me.
They said that they've done nothing wrong.
As soon as the dog heard his master's voice, off he ran like a shot.
You said that they could help us.
Harry says that he's feeling OK.
Tell them I'm coming.
I don't like the ocean.
Carmen doesn't seem to know what she has to do.
James didn't know that Alice had been sick.
May I have the check, please?
William said that Eva was glad that she didn't do that.
It appears that she had a nice time at the party.
Emma said she had a terrible cold.
She said she would come tomorrow.
Wait for your turn.
Joe will be waiting for me in front of the station.
Why didn't you take a taxi?
Her face suddenly turned red.
They may even ask if you are all right or if there is something they can help you with.
How did you know that I was going to get fired?
A policeman ran past.
I didn't know that you two were related.
Thomas jumped up, as if his friend were a ghost.
He said he needed our help.
She found several T-shirts she liked.
I wonder if Jami is married.
Live your life.
They've hanged themselves.
Carmen says she's never cried.
William hated to bother Lucy so late at night, but it was an emergency.
The children are all excited.
You're a grown woman now.
They call you Sue.
How did we not know that Joe and Susie were unhappy?
William disappeared on October 20th.
Monica said she'd win.
We can talk after dinner.
Jack didn't really feel like eating Korean food.
I didn't feel I needed to wait for Joe.
Adam is better off than he was this time last year.
I knew Adam wasn't going to do that.
She's making fun of you.
I was so happy that day.
I don't want Joe to come to my party.
George also studied law.
Can I join the team?
I teach third grade.
I believe that I belong here.
Do you see that cabin?
It's really smooth.
I don't need that anymore.
Don't blame Alex. He's only doing his duty.
You've been most helpful.
I won't confirm it.
James said that he hoped Julia would be able to help us today.
I think we should wait for them.
William was jumping up and down with excitement.
Monica says she hopes Harry knows who wants to do that.
I wonder whether George is OK.
I think I'll be able to do that this afternoon.
I don't drink a lot of wine.
William is proud of his son.
This is too good a chance to miss.
Harry came to Australia to look for a job.
He is not equal to her in intelligence.
We'll probably be able to figure this out eventually.
I think you should go there with Alex.
I might die soon.
William is getting ready to go to a party.
Jacob committed suicide in prison.
I've been thinking and I think that your decision is the best.
We wouldn't want to scare Joe.
Harry loved those jeans.
Jack came to school even though he was sick.
Joe didn't want to leave Anna behind.
I think Alex and Susie are still sick.
Jack and Monica are getting ahead of themselves.
James doesn't think that it'll be quite that easy to do that.
Adam loves cooking.
I'm sorry that you drew the short straw on this.
Tommy and Julia weren't sure what to do.
I don't think that it's anything we need to worry about.
Catherine said she planned to get home on Monday.
Harry pretty much stays at home.
Alex and Catherine say they don't speak French.
Jami says he's always dreamed of doing that.
He held his nose.
He ran the fastest of all.
Oscar might not eat this kind of cheese.
This land belongs to Harry.
I know that Alex knew that he shouldn't do that here.
She needs to talk to her lawyer.
Nobody ever comes here in the morning.
They've done their homework.
Please tell me why you want to leave.
I thought that we could hang out together.
Though young, he is wise.
I threw it in the river.
Alex said that Valentina wasn't at school.
I told him to make the deal.
It was fate.
We need to take them home.
I asked him to watch my things.
I wrote a book about China.
Adam and Laur said they wished John wouldn't do that.
James is in his office working late.
As soon as I sat down, I fell asleep.
Jami told me that he wouldn't go to Australia unless I went with him.
What food do you like most?
You shouldn't have to kiss Oliver.
Thank you for meeting me.
I'll let you know as soon as I know.
Where did this custom start?
Catherine said she was enjoying herself.
Muhammad wrote to a friend.
Her hair was as light as the clouds.
Be quiet while we're eating.
I thought that you'd be happy.
He said that he heard the gunshots.
We've never had anybody do that before.
Let me buy you a beer.
I think we can make a difference.
Stop arguing about money.
Oliver isn't sure where Mary parked her car.
Have Harry report here tomorrow morning.
James and Laur have admitted that they stole John's bicycle.
Under the circumstances I cannot allow the request.
Would you help me move this?
Oliver said that he isn't sure whether Olivia needs to do that.
I'm feeling younger again.
Julia was your teacher, wasn't she?
She felt someone touch her shoulder.
Eating raw eggs could be bad for you.
I want the same thing you do.
Joe hopes Eva knows that she shouldn't do anything John wants her to do.
You aren't supposed to burn trash here.
Jacob told me that he thought that Olivia was high.
I don't think that we'll get home before dark.
Olivia told me that she and Oliver were still married.
The man you saw yesterday is my uncle.
Tell me again where you live.
Just the same!
I know that you've been through a lot.
Get to know Alex.
I wonder if George really did that alone.
Do you want me to believe that there will be no music festival with foreign guests in Italy this summer?
Such a boy is loved by everybody.
Muhammad and Susie said they didn't really know what to buy.
I'd appreciate it if you'd wait a little bit longer.
Yesterday she was writing better than today.
I retired.
Adam wants his children to have a good education.
One of these days, I'll do that.
Both of my brothers did that.
I talked to Oliver just the other day.
He just kissed me. Nothing really happened.
They promised.
You're over-analyzing.
Jami is lost, isn't he?
I thought that you said that you didn't want to do that.
They've been out there a long time.
You must work together.
I'm going to go get Alex now.
Maybe you should leave me alone.
Adam remembered where Emma had told him to go.
I don't think we can win.
This isn't salt.
Please tell Jami to hurry up.
He has a bad temper.
Muhammad and Julia told John they didn't know how to do that.
He bought his daughter a dress.
Are you waiting for me to do that?
I'm getting too old for this.
We've got them.
That's more or less all I can say at the moment.
I really wanna go to the park today.
Jacob says he just couldn't permit Monica to do that.
How can you say that you have nothing to wear? Your closet is full of clothes.
Take a wild guess.
I plan to keep my promise.
Are you busy this coming Monday?
I'm sure it wasn't easy.
She told me that she was at home.
I can imagine how you felt.
It's rude to speak with your mouth full.
Olivia wishes she could speak French.
We were just about to start doing that.
Did you really expect Tommy to tell you the truth?
During a conversation, ask about the man you're talking to.
I'm still afraid to do that.
I don't mind in the slightest who he is.
You've got to help her.
Tommy is taking care of Julia's dog while she's away.
I'm the one you should be listening to.
His house is very far from the station.
I was pretty hungry.
Adam would've succeeded if he'd tried harder.
I've been to Australia, but only once.
We've had a long relationship.
George and Alice said they thought that would likely not happen.
I hang out with Harry a lot.
Oscar walked around the island.
Such conduct is beneath your dignity.
The next morning I found him traveling by train.
We must take that chance.
Who else do you know who can speak French?
George was in a terrible accident.
I'm not mad. I'm just sad.
They look like they need a vacation.
You don't seem to be even trying.
I had a similar problem when I was in Australia.
Harry headed back into the studio.
Do any of you need medical assistance?
A new museum is being built in the center of the city.
Judging from the expression on her face, she is worried.
I know Oliver knew why Valentina was doing that by herself.
William said he thought that Julia was too slow.
I think there's something wrong.
She didn't seem very busy, did she?
You must be really hungry.
Joe is cutting corners.
The old man the boat.
Is that why you called me?
My God! I left the wallet in my room!
A hundred dollars was a lot of money back then.
This is my driver.
Alex had fallen desperately in love with her.
Don't just ignore me.
Why won't Oscar go to Australia?
Provided that the fire department doesn't come to us!
I think Jacob can swim better than Eva.
She looked directly into his eyes.
He sometimes sleeps in.
Joe stayed after class to ask the teacher a few questions.
Alex convinced Margaret that she needed to do that.
William is one of the three guys who have to do that.
Joe never mentioned any of this to me before.
Oscar suggested we wait.
Don't be a slave to money.
Why are you suddenly aggressive?
You did exactly what Jacob wanted you to do.
Joe and Eva look like they're sick.
Neither Adam nor Susie has decided to move to Boston.
He gave a straight answer.
There's no money left in my bank account.
James opened the bedroom windows.
The train gathered speed.
They said that they'd like to win.
The work finally saw the light last month.
It is not far from the hotel.
Alex and Margaret tried to help me, but I told them I didn't need their help.
I've never heard you talk like that.
She's planning to travel the entire country.
Oscar told me he thought Anna knew French.
Julia will probably tell Adam what she needs to do.
I have to study for tomorrow's French exam.
Who would've thought?
I think we'll have time to do all that tomorrow.
Have you ever lived in Boston?
I'll send you a picture.
Oscar said that he'd rather go home.
I actually haven't done that yet.
Oh! Why me?!
Do you really think Oscar is good-looking?
You're weird - I like you.
Do you really believe you can beat Tommy?
I didn't like beer the first time that I tried it.
They say that he's very rich.
For what reason did you cry?
He's a little pale.
Why don't you call Eva and remind her?
They sent us the results.
Those were his very words.
That went right over his head.
Jack almost passed out from the pain.
Muhammad thought Anna was listening.
The baby will be able to walk soon.
Harry looked miserable.
Tommy realized he shouldn't do that.
Charlie made so many people happy.
How long will you be in Tokyo for?
Catherine told me that she might win.
That sounds painful.
I live pretty close to you.
I'm just trying to stay warm.
What would you do if you had one year free?
I wouldn't talk to George if I were you.
Susie said Muhammad knew she might not be allowed to do that by herself.
Do you think I need to get help?
Where did you study French?
Did you know George wasn't paid for doing that?
How did that get in here?
I want to learn French.
You cannot take pictures in the theater without permission.
You don't really need to do that, do you?
Charlie is sleeping right now.
James and Catherine say they hope John doesn't do that.
I wonder why Oscar is studying French.
Anna is going to wait for us, isn't she?
Have you already voted?
That'll never happen again.
School was exciting.
Have you been totally honest with me?
But that's not all that happened.
They made their beds.
It certainly wasn't easy to get James to help.
Try to look at it from their point of view.
She waited for me until I arrived.
Can you believe James?
They're counting their money.
Jacob is looking right at you.
Oh my god, it's delicious!
I don't think Jack wants to go to Boston with Emma.
Jack turned on his turn signal.
Jami told me that he was already married.
Tommy will find a place to live soon enough.
Don't disturb her. She is at work right now.
Who do you think'll be at the party?
She seemed to be happy, didn't she?
I told Jami and Carmen that I thought they looked drunk.
Who do you think made that mistake?
I can't understand a word you're saying.
Joe has done nothing illegal.
They need to improve their grades.
Return to the ship at once.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Carmen said she had somewhere to go.
This year, I need to buy a car.
She kept it hidden from me.
Did you tell Adam and Laur that they shouldn't be doing that?
I can show you a better way to do that.
After my father took his last breath, I had to phone my aunt in Germany and when I told her that he died, she corrected me: he passed on.
I thought that you said you were determined to do that.
Nobody is out of the woods yet.
That's certainly an interesting question.
Alex and Valentina don't want to be pilots.
They say they won't sing.
She admitted that she was cold.
I had not waited long before the bus came.
He wasn't always like that.
Tommy made me go against my will.
We've had a lot of problems with this machine.
William said he wished that you wouldn't do that by yourself.
Is the boss in a good mood today?
When did Adam get those jeans?
Alex isn't going to marry you.
I thought you said that you enjoyed golf.
Joe told me that he wasn't planning to stay very long.
George heard Monica was a good teacher.
Do Charlie and Olivia know I want them to do that?
On which chair did you put the book?
You were hoping to win, weren't you?
I know Charlie wants to become a plastic surgeon.
Eva put her hand on George's forehead to see if he had a fever.
George is good-natured.
Jacob ordered an extra large pizza.
If Joe breaks his promise, he'll regret it.
I brought something for you.
I don't think it'll be possible to do that without some help.
You need to stop doing that.
She was the one who suggested it.
The only one who knows how to do that is Oliver.
There is violence and chaos in the streets.
Having filled my suitcase, I hardly managed to close it.
Jacob can be contacted by phone.
Eva asked George if he knew why John didn't like her.
You should free those animals from the cage.
I haven't agreed to give all the details.
Tommy is hoping we'll do that with Susie.
Let's have a party for Catherine before she goes.
Adam said he thought the pilot was drunk.
One shouldn't take the hat away from a fool.
I have nothing in common with James so I don't know what to talk about.
I think that Jami is uncomfortable.
I admit that I was surprised.
It hasn't been easy for Muhammad to learn how to walk again.
George should probably not tell Monica he's hungry.
We have a big dog.
No, I can't. It's too big!
Adam and Monica got off their horses.
Jack must've been lying.
And Joseph was governor in the land of Egypt, and corn was sold by his direction to the people.
Jami took out his gun and shot Mary.
Do you know a better way?
The teacher walked into the class.
We had a lot of visitors yesterday.
Alex will probably tell Julia that she should make herself a couple of sandwiches.
Adam didn't know Hawaii was part of the United States.
They have a common hobby.
Oscar climbed into bed with his parents.
I'm glad that what George said was going to happen didn't happen.
I don't need to see it.
Oliver is playing with his son.
Do you want to end up like them?
He respects his elders.
When it comes to playing chess, he is second to none.
I'm going to shoot that guy.
I'm worth more than this.
I can't think about retirement yet.
Hasn't Charlie suffered enough?
Help me fix this.
I tell her everything.
I'll be coming back to Boston soon.
We've been here for three weeks now.
Jacob told me he'd be busy on Monday.
Hey, this is nice.
You don't understand at all.
I've never heard of him before.
She seemed happy to see me.
The men will be happy no matter what they get back.
Don't expose it to the rain!
Adam and Catherine are on their own.
Jacob fell and hurt his leg.
She could've done it by herself.
Wouldn't you rather stay for another hour?
Oscar quickly shut the book.
In case I forget, please remind me.
I can beat you.
Did anybody call for security?
Joe and Eva say that they aren't hungry yet.
She's playing with her toy truck.
I hope I can go to Australia one day.
Make yourselves comfortable.
You're annoying me!
Joe and Valentina say they don't know if they have time to do that.
I don't think that I can leave early.
We're going to the beach tomorrow.
The only country James and Alice have ever gone to is Australia.
She tied the dog to a tree.
I'm going with Joe.
Joe is a gentleman.
The second button of your shirt is coming off.
Tell George to lock the door.
How long you will be in Boston?
In general, it may be said that he is a genius in music.
Your car is more expensive than mine.
Neither Muhammad nor Monica has had many opportunities to do that.
I'm going on vacation next week.
Don't Muhammad and Monica sometimes do that?
Stop her.
I've loved you since the first time that I laid eyes on you.
She is not old.
They did not manage to keep it up in the second half.
They all loved it.
I could try.
Do you like this design?
Did you get the flowers I sent?
Do you think Oscar would care if Monica did that?
About this time tomorrow, we will be in London.
These guys only want to use you.
Laur has already done everything we've asked her to do.
I know Harry knows why Julia has to do that tomorrow.
One-third of the six members were women.
How could George possibly have known what I was doing?
Charlie is going to be very hurt if you do that.
He can do that any way he likes.
How long would it take us to do that?
She said that she wasn't happy here.
Harry came to talk to me this afternoon.
He has denied he cheated.
He was a handsome man.
You know I can't sing.
I don't want to blame anyone.
I'm still pretty angry.
I'm very fat.
Charlie died yesterday.
Jami found a job that he likes.
I don't remember anything at all.
It will only get better.
Do you think George and Lucy have already done that?
You knew that Adam told everybody he was going to do that, didn't you?
I drink coffee in a cafe.
I'm afraid it'll rain tomorrow.
Make sure William and Julia go to bed before 9:00.
You're a great coach.
I'm not sure what to do.
Are you still doing OK?
I'm back again.
You should let Alex know you'll probably be late.
As soon as William and Laur get here, we'll start the meeting.
Tommy said I didn't look like I was having a good time.
Everything is different today.
I can take Oscar to the park.
Are you sure you have enough money to buy that?
What's Germany's highest mountain?
While he was sick, he lost a lot of weight.
Oscar and Margaret didn't really mean to do that, did they?
This is very expensive.
I'm supposed to do this by myself.
Apparently you are right.
Adam is the guy who helped Valentina do that.
He is thirsty for fame.
What kind of cable do you need?
I couldn't go out, due to the heavy rain.
There were a few children in the room.
We all felt hungry.
You may do that any way you like.
One who is not willing to learn is not worth teaching.
I saw Tommy and could barely recognize him.
Do you think Jack and Valentina know what we were doing here?
Alex asked me if I cried.
Maybe you did that wrong.
You never gave me a chance.
Throw a rock at it.
I dare say she is still in Japan.
Divide the cake among you three.
They denied they did that.
Oliver is likely to still be tense.
I can't play the organ.
Not a star was to be seen.
I was just doing some reading.
You didn't know I was supposed to do that, did you?
This is very typical for you.
I hate pretending I like George.
I can understand him perfectly.
George seemed to be jealous.
Bring help.
I think it's pretty good.
William will be with us until next Monday.
They said they thinks you're stupid.
I expect Oscar to do that on October 20th.
What'll you be doing the day after tomorrow?
Who's your favorite baseball player?
They didn't break their promises.
Except for the weather, it was a great picnic.
Adam took a lot of pictures when he was in Australia.
Oh, no. I broke a string in my racket.
The defendant has no history of drug abuse.
Alex didn't think Valentina was bored.
Jacob and Laur said they had a very urgent matter to discuss with their boss.
I like this one.
Charlie said that he doesn't feel tired.
Charlie picked up right where he left off.
Tommy is very happy that Susie did that.
I wonder if Harry is downstairs.
William seemed to be tired tonight.
James will be driving Emma home.
I want my money back.
She said she was feeling bad.
Joe said he thought it wouldn't be possible to do that.
His behavior was that of a gentleman.
What should I explain?
It is necessary for you to start now.
I have to ask her first.
Do you remember what you were wearing the first time that I met you?
It's a well-known fact.
There is very little wine in the bottle, if any.
How could Adam know?
How much money do teachers make?
How could Joe do that to me?
I assumed that you'd be up at this hour.
It was the perfect place for monsters to hide.
To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible.
His answer is to the point.
I work as a cook.
William and Eva are serious.
Oscar is one of the thirty people who were told to do that.
Please see that the job is finished.
I won't forgive Oliver.
I helped Oliver.
Muhammad said he was going to Boston.
Let's join the celebration.
Jack doesn't seem very concerned about that problem.
I just wanted to listen to some music.
He has a very broad knowledge of the world.
All right, do it your own way, but don't blame me if you fail.
Many states have similar laws.
I'll show you around Boston.
I'm tired of all this noise.
Can we talk about this inside?
I don't like this drawing.
Jacob and Lucy said they wanted my help.
He was advanced to the rank of general.
Where did Jami and Mary go for their honeymoon?
Do you know where you're going?
If you want to succeed, you have to try harder.
You still look confused.
I'm just glad no one got hurt.
Can you find her?
Mrs. Smith can get her husband to do anything she likes.
I am quite ignorant of their plan.
Charlie was in the shower.
I've been going over your books.
George doesn't take Susie seriously.
I have been here for two years.
This river is deep enough to swim in.
I don't want you to do anything you're going to regret.
There's nothing I can do that Harry can't do.
Every woman was shocked at the sight.
These kids are so bright and so talented.
Adam thought it would be a good idea to see a doctor.
She's twenty-six (26).
I asked him if I could read his book.
I think it's a little too early to celebrate.
I am very much pleased with my new maid.
Are you at home next weekend?
Do you know where everybody else is?
I didn't say that I used to live in Australia.
I need to put some gas in the car, as it's almost empty.
At last, we got rid of him.
We have agreed on everything.
Do you still have a headache?
I don't think that Muhammad knows why he should do that.
Harry wore a long-sleeved shirt.
Forgive me, my love.
I think that Charlie might be able to do that.
That's what this is about.
I'll try and find Thomas for you.
Joe has been making an effort.
William didn't have to tell anybody anything.
You may be wrong.
A teacher's job isn't easy.
Life is full of surprises.
They gathered the pieces of the broken dish.
He was exhausted.
When did you find out that Jami wasn't the one who did that?
I wouldn't ask Harry to do anything that he doesn't really want to do.
Oliver says that you're a good student.
Why did God create the universe?
He arrived at the station.
James is talking.
That made me cry.
A nice big glass of water is a good way to start the day.
I often remember my happy childhood.
I've asked myself that question a thousand times.
Bill, open the door.
Ow, the coffee is very hot!
Do you sell town plans, please?
And it lasted until early morning.
He speaks as if he knew the criminal.
James thinks he's a good person.
The satellite is now in orbit.
Charlie is pretty tired.
Joe is waiting in the living room.
They're really proud of their kids.
Julia considered her answer carefully.
I'll get Jacob to do that for you.
I'm a police officer.
I thought Jack would show up.
I'm afraid of hospitals.
She's painting her fence.
The trouble with us is that we have no funds.
Jack is the only one who wasn't at Mary's party.
Did Oliver study with you?
Would you please allow me to treat you to dinner next week?
It was a fine sunny day.
I can explain everything to you.
I didn't want to listen to what he had to say.
Harry stood in a line for three hours.
I don't think that will fly.
The poem worked on her heart.
She is having lunch now.
John has a ready tongue.
Did you watch the soccer game on television?
I don't think that Jami will come to school today.
He will trust you.
Anna said she's only met George once.
We have to get James to a doctor.
She woke up on her own.
I was going to do that the day before yesterday.
Tommy said he thought that he might be allowed to do that again.
Oliver didn't know why Margaret was unhappy.
That was my point.
You can't lose that much weight.
You said you were going to go to Boston this weekend.
It takes time to understand this.
Winter is right around the corner.
I always wear a watch so I know what time it is.
Tommy seemed to like teaching French.
Oscar is likely going to be arrested.
Did you really break up with her over the phone? That's rude.
Joe promised that he would be more careful in the future.
The girl singing over there is my sister.
I couldn't care less what they say.
I wanted to stay in Australia, but I couldn't.
Susie can walk on her hands.
There are more of those in the drawer.
They forgot to pay their phone bills.
That made Joe smile.
I'll never be able to learn to dance.
Joe was the only other person who did that.
What makes you think Jami likes you?
Please find her.
Why don't you invite them over?
Aren't you planning to go to Australia with Jami?
Who is she?
William and Valentina told me they won.
George has to deal with this alone.
When I was playing video games in the living room, Mother asked me if I would go shopping with her.
She doesn't love anyone, and no one loves her.
We thank you very much!
I said I saw Harry.
The house was destroyed by the flood.
We have an important matter to discuss.
Jack didn't take a bath for a week.
I think George doesn't know how to do that.
Muhammad looks like he's upset.
This road will take you to the station.
Who told Adam that he could do that?
We're going to set off at four.
The summer holidays are over.
George and Carmen said that they remembered being there.
James said that he'd rather do that alone.
I helped cook lunch.
I think my wife may be cheating on me.
He cannot be older than I.
Do you want anything else?
Go away! I hate you!
I'm dying to pick some fresh fruit.
Tommy ate the apple.
I have not finished the task yet.
I think you can handle it.
Don't take any notice of what he said.
If you act like that, he'll think you hate him.
Jacob certainly has a temper.
I can't ride a motorcycle.
Oscar and Lucy both know John isn't happy here.
We've had a lot of chances to do that.
We have almost 300 employees.
One can't play baseball here.
William told me to do whatever I want to do.
Jami didn't seem to be as slow as Alice seemed to be.
We had no choice. We had to do what they told us to do.
I already plan to do that.
Alex had a party at his place Monday evening.
Charlie sat on the steps talking to a girl named Catherine.
A native speaker wouldn't likely say it that way.
I hope I can find a buyer for this.
Jack didn't realize that we could to do that.
The flood was the greatest disaster they had ever had.
William has not slept for two days.
What train is William coming in on?
Is it different this time?
I bought a shirt yesterday.
William thought that he had come up with the perfect plan.
Oscar cries a lot.
What's Joe ever done to you?
It gets worse.
My best friend was in that teacher's class.
Every time I see this photo, I think of my father.
Was Emma wearing a cape?
I've already had lunch.
He must not live.
Jacob said that isn't the only reason why Margaret should do that.
Harry's very upset about something.
Tommy didn't seem very nervous.
She says that she'll wait.
Both my parents are not alive.
If you want to blame somebody, blame me.
I know his family.
Not a sound was heard.
There is little sympathy in the letter.
I definitely have to do that.
Thank you again for your help.
I didn't understand how to do that.
That's worth a lot to me.
Muhammad is back in Boston, isn't he?
How should organize my writing?
You heard the news?
Oliver doesn't want to let Lucy go.
You don't have to talk.
You should report this to the police.
Was your dad a thief? Because he stole all of the stars in the sky and put them in your eyes.
I'm going with them.
Put yourself in my position. What would you have done?
Joe is a bad influence on you.
That car belongs to Oscar.
I'm too busy to do that right now.
Everything looks pretty normal.
Someone tried to poison Charlie.
Does this happen often?
George worked.
I know why George didn't do that.
Sometimes you need to distance yourself to see things clearly.
We admit that he is a man of ability.
Laurie slept with Emily, her best friend.
Jacob was extremely popular.
I think you think too much.
Valentina lives with her husband in Boston.
I didn't know both Jami and Lucy were still in prison.
Maybe I don't love you.
I'll do it anyway.
This was very unlike Oliver.
I thought you were going to Australia.
Oliver told Julia she needed to be in Australia next Monday.
Jacob isn't cruel.
I like the way Oscar does that.
Drink your medicine.
I couldn't find a job in Boston.
This seems to be a pretty nice place.
He's as beautiful as the sun.
This is getting boring.
What does the bill amount to?
We'll be right there.
Charlie and Susie told me they weren't feeling very good.
They hate insects.
It's a beautiful sword.
I will not die here.
How do you know I didn't volunteer?
James didn't have to think long.
They want this.
We'll all miss you, Joe.
If only it would stop raining!
She wanted to call her lawyer.
I don't want to spend any more time than necessary cleaning the house.
Are you still planning on going back to Australia?
Taking a photo with the trees in the background.
You didn't do that for me, did you?
I have taken food.
George decided to try.
George and Alice say that they've met you.
Where did Oscar point?
They stole my bag.
There's nothing we can do now.
What I really want to hear about is Harry's new girlfriend.
I walked for two hours in the afternoon heat.
You know that isn't right, don't you?
William knows what kind of person Catherine is.
You do that differently than Tommy.
The fish fought hard.
Oscar wondered why Emma had never gotten a driver's license.
William seemed to be healthy.
I don't know whether I'll have time to do that.
Watch what I do very carefully.
I want to be an artist.
George has also left.
He always wears heavy clothes.
The teacher didn't know what to say.
She went in for the audition last week.
The press will be watching.
Jami laid down the gun on the floor.
I know Alex was going to do that today.
Why do you think James ought to do that?
It's raining outside. Don't forget to close the windows when you get back home.
Do you want me to look into that matter?
She's probably just gone to visit her parents.
She almost got away with it.
Muhammad asked his friends if they thought Catherine liked him.
We hired them.
Have you been in Rio?
They weren't sure that they could do that.
Jacob and Catherine have been doing that all their lives.
Please introduce me to your new friends.
They were really concerned.
It's a good thing you didn't go to Jack's party.
I don't think it'll take very long to do that.
My plan has been rejected.
Racing car drivers aren't just in it for the prize money but also for the thrill of racing.
The answer was easy.
People don't want the truth.
Jane filled out an application.
James said that Lucy thought John might have to do that on Monday.
I'm writing a new book.
I think it's a serious problem.
He has done what he had to do.
She wanted to ask a question, so she raised her hand.
Tommy believes Anna is wrong.
Valentina sounds like her mother.
The yen rose to the dollar.
Charlie admitted he didn't win.
My father has bought a new car.
Oscar still can't speak French very well.
I'll sing by myself.
I don't think that we'll meet again.
Chin up!
Adam said he wanted to go swimming.
I thought Alex would give Mary John's phone number.
What was in the envelope?
Jack is waiting for someone to come pick him up.
I can't believe you're going to ask Monica to marry you.
This is something I must face alone.
I'm often mistaken.
Emma asked James to drive her home.
His company didn't survive the crisis.
Don't forget that Jami has no sense of humor.
Please just do everything I do.
William is setting the table for dinner.
The problem is I still don't know if I can trust you.
These shoes don't fit my feet.
That can happen sometimes.
Where did you get the money?
I'm pretty sure about that.
Have you ever been to Asia?
He survived a flight accident.
Let me make you some coffee.
Julia told William that she was interested.
I finally caught up with my friends.
Why don't you lie down for a while?
You should do your best in everything.
I don't think anyone really understands me.
He has a maid to wait on him.
It sounds like Joe was unconscious.
A baby deer can stand as soon as it's born.
I hope Tommy is going to be sensible about that.
Tommy is fed up with Valentina's bad behavior.
The door was still closed.
I catch the flu every year.
Just sit down and listen to me.
Catherine is average looking.
I appreciate your integrity.
I thought you could do it for me.
Let's just leave it at that.
They say they'll do whatever they can.
I'll show you to the station.
Oscar and Catherine did better this time than they did last time.
I know that Tommy didn't know that I'd never done that.
I didn't know that you weren't planning on doing that with Joe.
Jami appears to be winning.
He broke his right arm.
This is a picture of my drawing.
I enjoyed getting to know him.
The door was difficult to open.
Carmen felt that she owed Alex an explanation.
Do you think that's all we need to do?
Now what will all the idiots believe who remained alive?
William told me he hoped that Laur would be back soon.
Maria wrote me a letter.
Oscar explained that he was the one who had done that.
I'm glad that he passed the exam.
Tell me why George and Catherine aren't here.
It wasn't as simple to do as we thought it was going to be.
Julia is studying French now, isn't she?
I'd be disappointed if you did that.
I haven't taken out the garbage.
I thought that you'd miss your train.
He got good marks in math.
Charlie has been a great help to me.
You're Emily.
It is no use looking for the cake; I already ate it.
Muhammad knew that I was going to do that.
Why do we have to do this?
I want to buy Adam a present.
He said he didn't enjoy doing that.
They're asking us to help them.
Did you even know his name was Alex?
I didn't feel I should do what Charlie and Valentina were doing.
The moon came out from behind the clouds.
That's what I wished for.
I can hear everything.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; the fact is that you have to.
The man robbed him of all his money.
I don't claim that we're perfect.
Jacob did the work by himself.
Jacob and Emma are planning to vote for the same candidate.
Why did they kick you out of school?
I don't think Joe is blind.
I know James would be able to do that if he really needed to.
William thought Mary was nervous.
Do you know when Harry returned?
I'm pretty happy with the progress we've made.
I hope that Julia passes the examination.
This example is a little more complex.
How did that get into your head?
Right now, I'm more worried what may happen to you than what may happen to me.
He doesn't have the strength to say anything.
Thank you very much! â You're welcome.
I doubt if George will be bored.
James and Anna claimed they weren't the ones who did that.
Valentina said she was feeling bad.
When you were two years old, you could already count to ten.
Do you have an umbrella that I could borrow?
She sometimes helps her mother.
The restaurant we went to yesterday was quite good.
I feel like I was born in the wrong time.
I thought that you didn't know how to do anything.
I asked him if he knew her well.
Suddenly, Harry collapsed onto the ground.
It's more difficult than it looks.
Oliver should probably not tell Eva he's going to Australia.
If you look at the song's lyrics, they really don't mean much.
I want you to love me for who I am.
Just think about this.
I have no idea what I need to do now.
I hope you find them.
I am bringing down this old wall.
I'm looking for them.
Mary is visiting Boston, isn't she?
I'm just as busy as you are.
Charlie and Monica are the ones who told John to do that.
I can't give in; that's just how I am.
I saw Muhammad doing it.
That's not exactly what I agreed to do.
Jami is as busy as ever.
It has been her dream to be a university professor.
Why don't you go get them?
To go faster you'd better go alone, to go further you'd better go with someone.
I think you should open an account here.
Adam said that everybody he knows does that.
I'm all better now.
I know Oscar won't try to do that.
Although the sun was out, it was cold.
Why don't I just talk to them?
I suspect that Charlie has been injured.
Emma doesn't go to the market, no matter if Jacob goes to the market.
The manager put up a notice about the extra holiday.
She told me she wasn't tired.
Greedy cats are out for a fast buck.
"But you just come here in the summer!" Said Tony.
Alex said Anna was hoping she could help John.
It was the last battle that ended the war.
I wonder whether William did what he said he'd do.
I've been told to do that.
Did you watch TV tonight?
I deserved their trust.
I just don't agree with them.
Please do not write in this library book.
I don't want her to go to jail.
I was kind of surprised Tommy said that he'd do that.
Oliver knows he isn't likely to be punished.
She saved us all.
George sells most of the vegetables that he grows.
I need you to help me.
It seems we are in the same boat.
If God had meant for us to be naked, we'd have been born that way.
Harry works at Harvard.
Charlie said he freaked out.
Please take your hands off me.
I didn't tell Anna why I didn't want her to go to Boston with me.
Adam wants to be popular.
Try hard to hold it tight!
We had a picnic last weekend.
How many dogs does Mary have?
I think his name is Adam.
She walked towards her house.
Adam thinks I don't need to do that.
She's in the kitchen.
I know you feel grateful.
What's he doing out there? Invite him inside!
Monica could no longer control herself.
Adam is in a meeting right now.
I love no one more than you.
I just hope no one saw me.
Happiness is a choice.
Would you like tea or something?
The Old Man and the Sea is a very exciting book.
I got turned off.
I think Adam and Olivia both want to go to Australia.
She says she plans to do that.
Rules are important for everyone.
I liked staying in Boston.
We'll have to do a bit of walking to get from here to the bank.
I know William wouldn't be stupid enough to do that alone.
I've made some decisions.
So I want to explain who these people are.
She's writing at her desk.
There's something sort of familiar about you.
He said he'd be right back.
James was not interested in her.
Shut up and let me think.
The Queen and her husband visited the castle for a few days.
Any amount of money will be welcome.
It was easy for them.
Do you think Joe and Valentina are still home?
We need to settle our accounts.
James says he isn't interested in sports.
She invited me to join her.
I could've shown you how to do that.
Although you rushed, you're not ready.
You're not telling me the truth.
Harry is all by himself, isn't he?
William told me someone was trying to kill him.
Jami has be doing that for a few years.
I think Tommy and Monica would be happier if they did that.
Jack is desperate to do that, isn't he?
He somehow managed to swim across the river.
As we have opportunity, let us do good.
It's healthy to be crazy.
The movie has already started.
Jami is somebody you can rely on.
The new bridge will have been completed by March.
She wants to become thin very much.
I should've known Jacob and Emma wouldn't do what we asked them to do.
Say which one you would like.
Muhammad will keep coming.
He said he was dog-tired.
Muhammad is quick-witted.
Her hands are shaking.
Jack retired at the age of 67.
Jami is used to this kind of situation.
Alice looks like she's about to faint.
Let's do better than that.
The police believe Tommy was involved in the murder.
I'd really rather be alone right now.
I know Adam would be upset if I did that.
Harry has three grown sons.
Can they see the picture?
Jack knows he isn't likely to be fired.
What time is it by your watch?
I am not saying it for my own sake.
She seemed a little hard on herself.
Here's the bus.
It's sad.
We've got much bigger problems to deal with.
The scene lying before us was very beautiful.
Charlie may have already done that.
There's no bad weather, there's bad clothing.
I ran into a friend of mine on the bus.
I went to the library to read books.
I wasn't able to stay up all night.
Can I use the bathroom?
Jacob and Valentina said that they don't plan on going.
Luck plays an important role in our life.
You won't be able to recognize yourself.
"Are you still dating Jack?" "No, we broke up at the beginning of last month."
You must keep the promises you make.
He is said to know a lot about Spain.
No one would loan me money.
Charlie had a good dinner.
Isn't life just great?
I still can't reach them.
Margaret promised me she'd clean her room.
George said you'd do that for him.
Will a new technology be of any great use to mankind?
"No one will ever believe that." "Well, Harry believed me."
An expert was called for advice.
I entered my daughter in a girl's school.
I think I'll have to attend that meeting.
Jami has been taken back to jail.
Without your help, I would've been unable to do it.
I will have been studying for five years next February.
I know that Muhammad can't do that today.
Tommy told Olivia how old he was.
I'll have to send my camera out for repair.
I'll examine it for myself.
Oliver and Carmen still do that whenever they can.
I come from Australia.
Oliver is likely to wait for us.
Emma was dismissed from her job.
I've been asked to do something that I don't want to do.
She told me that she was wealthy.
I'm still not sure who they are.
You didn't really mean that, did you?
The police recovered the stolen jewelry.
I suspect Adam will probably want to do that.
I haven't been sleeping very much lately.
I feel that it is better to stay single than to get married.
Charlie said he'll be in Boston next week.
He made me so angry that I got a headache.
They removed their socks.
We're talking about you.
Let's go tell Oliver the good news.
I don't have any cigarettes. Give me just one cigarette!
This is a picture of her own painting.
What've you been doing to them?
Alice forgot to tell William what time she'd be there.
Did Tommy and Catherine do that themselves?
I can do that for her.
She looked like she was afraid.
It was surprising that Muhammad didn't get hurt.
I don't think that Oscar was nervous.
Give it to me!
We went to Australia by plane.
The two cars tried to make way for each other.
Jack is convinced that's a good idea.
I was very fortunate to have a chance to do that.
James doesn't think Margaret would be afraid to do that.
They tied my hands to the chair.
The sun was hidden by the mountain.
She studies English.
We don't want anybody to find out.
I asked who wouldn't come tomorrow.
Jacob told me he wouldn't eat until 2:30.
You matter because you are you, and you matter until the last moment of your life.
He knows what he needs to do.
Joe is older than us.
When was the last time you made up?
Bold as brass.
He's not a very nice guy.
Oliver didn't say who he'd gone with.
He makes sense.
I swear to God.
He has quite a few friends.
Tommy and Mary argue a lot, but they still get along quite well together.
I'd like to be in a band.
We look for good luck, bad luck looks for us.
George had that job for years.
Oliver and Catherine said that they weren't at home on Monday.
Sir, we will have something special for you.
I prefer department stores: the prices are lower.
It'll be difficult to find a job now.
Adam and Monica haven't paid their taxes.
People really are stupid sometimes.
I'm going to try to quit smoking.
You really should tell Harry that.
They bought everything they wanted.
I told Jacob he should rest.
Good day. Would you please bring me a mug of coffee?
Oscar said he was glad that he did that.
This milk won't keep till tomorrow.
Do you think that I should go talk to Oscar?
Charlie has a lot to be grateful for.
I'm pretty sure Jami is sincere.
Adam has lived in Australia for many years.
Charlie heard Emma's cries for help.
Everything is bigger in Texas.
May I go over to Oscar's house to play?
I'll try to speak to you as soon as Jami has left.
George was the last kid to go home.
They're a complete joke.
I have a huge crush on Alex.
I think it's time to make some changes.
We have so much to learn.
He said he didn't have a dog.
Someone was here.
I fell asleep before the end of the movie.
He was unlucky, wasn't he?
Muhammad is fairly sure he can win.
Harry is likely to still be shy.
There were flowers everywhere.
It's a very serious matter.
She writes a very good hand.
Can I pick the desk by the window?
Have you even heard a word I've said?
How could Oscar do this to us?
We may all have to leave.
Joe ended the relationship.
Oscar said that he thought that he could take care of himself.
I think it's time for me to buy a house.
Let's go now.
Jami and Anna might've eaten on their way home.
He said to me, "Children are like small animals."
He doesn't seem to get on in the world.
Do you really think William was embarrassed?
You can do what you like.
Do you still think that there's a chance that you'll do that tomorrow?
I returned home after an absence of two years.
After he heard the news, William was in seventh heaven.
You look younger than her.
Muhammad and Catherine admitted that they'd been foolish.
My brother insisted on going alone.
Do you think Jami should do that alone?
We text each other all the time.
Emma says she knows George will want to do that.
I know that Oliver is a bright kid.
It was a dangerous trip.
Once in a while, he leaves his umbrella on the train.
My home lies far across the sea.
Muhammad and Julia let me drive their car.
I'll be on the next flight back to Boston.
It's famous.
Nobody is in the living room, but the TV is on.
This is getting really creepy.
We should leave her alone.
John said that he had met this man at the conference.
My door is always open for you, James. Come to me if you have any problems.
I'll visit my uncle next week.
I met him here.
Jack and Susie don't plan to be there.
I think that we made the right decision.
Oscar said he was sleepy.
I'm interested in French.
You look bad.
Adam is afraid to go outside.
You're going to love Oliver.
I refuse to be treated like a slave by you.
There's something I want to ask you.
I know a lot about you.
Charlie doesn't know I don't know how to do that.
Adam is lying on the sofa watching TV.
Please, go ahead.
I don't want you touching my stuff.
George and Margaret were doing what they loved.
Today we will be spoiled by spring sunshine.
I'll give you a day to think about it.
Oh my gosh. I will be late for lessons.
I told them to send me another ticket.
Everyone loves fresh bread.
Muhammad didn't seem to be convinced that Eva had to do that.
I don't care what your mother said.
May I use the phone?
There was nothing else I needed to do.
I want to know more about them.
Everybody seems to be having fun.
We're being very careful not to do that.
George said he didn't expect Olivia to do that.
The man is in the kitchen.
I slept on the boat.
You'd better not argue with Alex.
Does that seem fair to you?
Did you write to your wife when you were in the army?
Let's not talk about my problems.
Count from one to a hundred.
Why don't you go to school?
I wasn't allowed to eat.
I came to talk to you.
This pair of shoes cost me $30.
No complaints have been reported.
Adam won't likely tell Alice he's tired.
I wasn't born in Boston.
You might not like doing that.
Have you ever dealt with this kind of a problem before?
I'm the one who rescued them.
I know James is a better driver than I am.
Is this positive news?
Why were you in Boston last week?
Jami is going to the dentist on Monday.
I thought that Jack would be last.
This is where the magic happens.
Cookie is younger than Kate by ten years.
They say they like it.
You'll die if you don't tell the truth.
Harry and Julia missed their bus.
Can I tell Joe?
We were unable to follow his logic.
You knew I had to do that, didn't you?
I had to leave Boston.
She's here to protect you.
I cannot help laughing to hear such a story.
You're the only one who isn't able to do that, aren't you?
I have enough; I don't want more.
What's that got to do with him?
I thought that you could do it for me.
We're just average folks.
It's familiar to me.
The young woman sat on the couch.
I'm afraid that wasn't possible.
I didn't know that Oliver had done that.
Let them stay.
She'd lend you money if she had any.
Anna probably has an extra pencil she could lend you.
He's always so busy.
"I've found a way to make him really jealous." "Oh, do tell!"
Tommy and I aren't in danger, are we?
She sells food.
Do you think Jack would like to go camping with us next weekend?
I'll have to go myself.
He has just arrived here.
Tell Adam I know why he did that.
I work hard in the garden.
They'd do whatever you ask them to do.
I thought that you were going to offer me the job.
I made Jami stay.
I assure you Adam is quite well.
Jami isn't the enemy.
I decided to take matters in my own hands.
Oliver will probably find some way to do that.
I have noticed that the bus drivers can't brake.
Oscar is the only person I can trust to do that.
Where did he eat last night?
I think Oscar is already able to do that.
Joe was about to burst into tears.
William will try to be there on time.
Who sells this?
Muhammad needs to be told that he doesn't need to do that.
It was to say that going to the station was too much of a bother after all so I should come to the hotel she's staying at. Good grief, what a selfish woman!
Alex has stopped coming to church.
"How much does an elephant eat each day?" "I think I read somewhere that an elephant can eat about 150 pounds of plants on a daily basis."
Sooner or later, someone's going to have to tell Valentina that she needs to behave herself.
Will I be able to keep my job?
I wanted some wine, but there was none left.
Her hair was so long that it reached the floor.
If for some reason that happened, what would you do?
If you care to, come with us.
Tell us what happened.
Muhammad doesn't remember if he locked the door.
I don't have enough money to buy everything I need.
The hunter shot and killed the fox.
It appears that her injury was pretty bad.
He is still alive.
Ask him to speak louder. He can't be understood.
Please help me!
They found their keys under the sofa.
Julia said she didn't feel like a hero.
I agree to your plan.
They couldn't keep from crying.
Jacob and Emma are in their rooms sleeping.
I was getting suspicious.
You said it was beef. However, I think it's pork.
Let me show you the pictures I took in Boston.
William and Monica said that they were worn out.
You know that you can tell me anything, right?
Carmen said she heard someone yelling.
What a pleasant day!
I'm going to tell Adam the truth.
Alice told me she's upset.
In the summer I go to the sea and in winter I go to the mountain.
What if nothing happens?
He put her savings to good use.
William is going to study French with Valentina.
Jim can fly upside down.
I parked my car near the main entrance.
The authorities started going into the case.
I can't remember where you were born.
I tried to volunteer to do that, but they didn't want my help.
I'm sure Oscar wouldn't double-cross me.
He took a beautiful shot at a deer.
It's high time to get going!
You're a creep.
Don't leave me here alone.
Did Muhammad change his story?
I'm broke and tired.
I know what I'm getting into.
Didn't you know that very few people actually do that anymore?
Do not make fun of me.
I'll die if I don't take this medicine every day.
You must take good care of yourself.
Adam is one of the most decent men I know.
Lucy said she would do it again.
You girls look amazing!
Oliver is likely to be alone.
Are they all like this?
Could you give this to Jami?
It's warm today.
I'll not be at home next Sunday.
James said he has something he wanted to do this afternoon.
The axe is very important in American culture.
I know that Jami knows he shouldn't be doing that.
George offered to help Valentina.
Joe said that Monica was likely to be right.
How much support do you need?
Who's that guy?
George should have been found guilty.
I can take you home.
I'm living in Boston at the moment.
He laughed in spite of himself.
Tommy and Susie said they were trying to figure something out.
I knew that Jami would be back.
James came right away.
I need to get out of here.
I have a lot of experience in computers.
Tommy hoped he might hear from Margaret.
Tell William and Susie I'd like to talk to them.
Jami almost won the race.
I used to go to Boston when I was a kid.
Oscar kind of looks like somebody I used to know.
Could you please tell Alice that I need to see her?
Muhammad seemed to know just about everyone.
Jami needs help nearly as badly as we do.
You are here now in a doctor's surgery.
I know Joe knew I didn't do that.
We will call you when your order arrives.
William's eyes were full of tears.
She usually talks about her late husband.
Jack ran outside to see what was happening.
It's not going to be a disaster.
I'll go and prepare something.
I feel pretty good about it.
George played a sad song on the piano.
Tears began to spill down his cheeks.
I'll go to the hospital today.
Jack and Emma did what you told them to do.
He does exactly what I tell him.
The dog looks at the cat.
That's the reason Charlie and I were late today.
He has green eyes.
What did that prove?
He is on this ship.
Let's keep this private.
Let's see if Alex and Catherine are at home.
She knows what she should do.
It was all good.
So many places, I haven't been to.
I've decided not to live in Australia any longer.
Can't you turn that thing off?
James doesn't even read the newspaper.
It's sad to see Jacob so unhappy.
Oliver didn't believe his eyes.
She always keeps a stick in her hand.
I've known Oscar ever since I was a kid.
Why does Oscar want to leave Australia?
If you get sleepy, let me know.
I was just taking a shower.
Don't let anyone into the room.
Jami isn't happy you're late again.
Margaret decided she wouldn't worry about that.
Carmen said she felt alone.
How long have you known Jack?
I didn't see him again.
My son is a journalist.
You shot her.
Muhammad and Alice looked like they were in a hurry.
Jacob says that there's no chance Alice will be fired.
These scissors are suitable for left and right-handed people.
This was hardly a shock.
I know that Jami can do that without Olivia's help.
I'm not sure that that's what Tommy wants to do.
Adam told Monica that she should quit pretending to be helpless.
Oliver has some questions that he'd like to ask you.
I don't understand why Jacob had to do that.
This is a gold mine.
He is helping this lady enter her car.
You must think I came down in the last shower to expect me to believe that.
It doesn't look like it'll clear up today.
You're looking at that tree.
There's another alternative.
Being exhausted, she was soon fast asleep.
Neither Jacob nor Emma has found a job in Australia.
I'm working with him now.
Go on board.
When one does not like someone, one easily believes the bad things that are said about him.
I thought you said you were staying until 2:30.
Oliver is a famous artist.
Physics doesn't interest me at all.
They were told that they were too short.
I thought that you were raised in Australia.
It will have been raining for a week if it does not stop tomorrow.
You're a real witch.
Are you questioning my plan?
Muhammad said that he was glad that Margaret was able to do that.
He finally succeeded.
Let me have a look at that.
Jacob looked both ways before crossing the road.
They said that they didn't do that anymore.
George seems to be relaxed.
We went to the park to play.
I think Charlie was the one who did that.
I don't ever expect to be a bride myself.
This fact proves his innocence.
Harry is going to come to live with us.
Charlie bought us some drinks.
George wants to know if it hurts.
Neither William nor Valentina wants to eat Thai food for lunch.
Jacob seemed to understand why Mary wanted to be alone.
Could you please tell Olivia why you don't want her to do that?
Would Jack care if we did that?
That isn't much.
I'm not sure of anything.
Adam is not very likely to want to do that.
He says he doesn't feel well today.
Please find me my wallet.
Jami said he'd do that in a couple of days.
I am feeling better today.
I know that Charlie is going to let you do that with him.
I know Jacob knows Mary doesn't how to do that.
I'll show you the ropes.
They're not expensive.
Come on, you're wasting time.
Let's pretend it never happened.
Muhammad has just finished cleaning his room.
I'd rather stay home and sleep all day.
I wanted to get home before 2:30.
Do you really think Harry and Julia are poor?
It's very likely Alex will be there.
Oscar didn't know what time he was supposed to leave.
I don't doubt it in the least.
We could be happy here.
May I do that?
I don't know why we have to do that.
Was there an affair?
You don't seem to be as creative as Adam is.
I am an earthquake.
I cracked the code.
I'm going to keep working.
She began to wish she were dead.
I want us to be a family.
I had no idea Muhammad and Valentina were not happy.
They know we trust them.
Be careful not to do that again.
Charlie and I both did that.
William is still homeless, isn't he?
We won't stand a chance.
I know that Jack used to be a soldier.
You never told me what it was.
That's very natural-sounding Japanese.
What do you have in your right hand?
It's not always hot in Boston.
George said that he wouldn't say anything.
He is literally stupid.
This could come in handy.
I hope Alex does that on Monday.
Oscar knows he has to do that today.
They were so different.
Last night saw a fire in my neighborhood.
He's the one who touched me.
Tommy should've finished his homework by now.
New laws are needed.
The iron exploded.
Have you recovered from the shock?
Let's send Harry a Christmas card this year.
I'd advise waiting until at least Monday.
Thanks for the opportunity.
We don't care what James thinks.
I can't do what you're asking me to do.
Charlie is going to laugh when he sees this.
Muhammad doesn't think Alice will be cold.
What else would you like to see?
Would you mind looking after my kids?
Alex said he'd help Mary do that as well.
I always leave the window open while I sleep.
I had my photo taken on the shore of the lake.
If I'd had time to do that, I would've.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Is this the real truth?
Would you mind if I sleep here tonight?
I didn't know Jacob was your significant other.
They said that they've been offered $3,000.
Joe was at school when Carmen called him.
Italian men never help in the house.
Harry used to drink like a fish.
Oh please, believe me.
Volunteers are needed.
As I was speaking, Mother came up.
They put on their rubber gloves.
Oh well. That's no big deal.
Tommy didn't know just what to say.
Harry and Julia should've left when they had the chance.
Oscar cleaned the fish.
Let's not do this again.
They said they wanted us to visit them.
Charlie said he wouldn't be able to do that.
We need an air force.
You're not paid to ask questions.
Where did Jack get the idea?
It will do harm to us.
I think that Adam is still alive.
Alex thought that Eva didn't like him anymore.
She doesn't think it's her fault.
Charlie has a sharp mind.
I'll definitely try doing that today.
Jami and Valentina say they don't need to do that.
Adam said that's not what Julia wants.
I didn't know Jami and Margaret would be here, but I'm glad they are.
Everybody else is doing that.
We're certain.
It's rather cold.
You really hurt me.
Muhammad has already decided not to go Boston next summer.
I don't think Oscar wants to leave today.
The process was quick.
I told William that he shouldn't do that.
They said they would do that again.
Muhammad said that he thought Anna hated John.
You're full of shit.
I don't think Charlie and Lucy know that I hate them.
I will see them next week.
Didn't you know Lucy was Oscar's girlfriend?
Do you have any idea why Oscar and Laur are mad at me?
Why are you planning to move to Boston?
I like these chairs.
Jacob and Valentina didn't have enough money to buy what they needed to buy.
I figured that Harry was sleeping.
Jack tried to translate a book into French.
I have decided to go a little further.
They both got three weeks' detention.
Maybe Joe doesn't know that Mary was the one who did that.
We're so busy.
Oliver says he wants to help Valentina do that.
We've been expecting her.
Someone planted a bomb under your car.
It wasn't anything serious.
Jack put his hand on the small of her back.
What should we call the company?
James made everything.
My father hasn't gone abroad even once.
We'd better leave.
Tommy said he was ready to defend himself.
I'm very depressed.
Jacob's family is very traditional.
Charlie is desperate.
George and Julia are so boring.
How badly was Charlie hurt?
Adam and Susie don't talk to each other anymore.
I sure hope George can take care of himself.
That is an amazing photograph.
They did not work, either.
I want you to stay in Australia at least until Christmas.
The door wasn't closed.
That's the school I used to go to.
The dress Laur was wearing was white.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
I thought you said you could finish writing the report by today.
My Chinese did not pass.
I know Muhammad isn't a taxi driver anymore.
I thought you said it was yours.
There's something that isn't right.
I know James and Eva went to Boston together.
I want to hear what Tommy thinks.
If you don't help me, I won't be able to do that.
I only live here because it's close to work.
Write to me as soon as you get there.
I made very short work of the big steak.
I love to eat french fries with fish.
They said they thought I looked sad.
Charlie won't be right.
Joe and Julia said they did that already.
He will run for mayor.
I'm looking forward to visiting your country this winter.
Jack and Mary aren't who you think they are.
I did my best.
William doesn't think Valentina can stop him from doing that.
We are having dinner.
Alex doesn't think Valentina will be able to do that by herself.
Tommy is a handsome guy.
Jack is getting ready for bed.
Harry gave me his address.
She might've done that by herself.
Where am I? What happened?
As a child, I liked baseball better than football.
Charlie said that last night's concert was three hours.
I'm not at all busy now.
I wonder whether Oscar knows Margaret was involved in a traffic accident.
Where's the pen?
They're painting the house themselves.
Did you buy anything for them?
Let them show you how it's done.
Would you tell me why you don't like James?
This stuff's awful.
May I go to the fountain?
Tommy came to save me.
Joe said that Valentina isn't jealous.
Both Joe and Valentina aren't hungry.
There's little hope Jacob will be here on time.
Jacob said that he didn't think that would happen.
I think Charlie didn't know Mary spoke French.
It'll probably be interesting for you to do that.
It's very old.
Jami and Susie both left the office early today.
I have paperwork to finish up.
What time did Adam say he wanted to leave?
I was hoping I'd meet you.
He said the United States would not interfere.
What have you been doing up till now?
She taught music for thirty years.
William and Margaret told me that they wanted a dog.
He isn't quite himself lately.
George always gets up at 6:30.
Why don't we go meet Charlie?
The bomb exploded, but no one was hurt.
Maybe that's not enough.
Miss Green asked two questions of me.
Do you have a husband?
He is poor, but honest.
Joe had a bad day at the office.
George said that Olivia was asleep by the time he got home.
It's getting late. I gotta go.
I thought I heard Joe was going to do that.
Joe says I'm the one with the problem.
I changed my hair, but he didn't like it.
Harry's mother would've been very proud of him.
These are for us.
He can do that himself.
Alice says she hopes Jami knows he has to do that.
Oscar doesn't like to get his picture taken.
Apparently, I was wrong.
Surely you told somebody.
Could you tell me what's bothering you?
Tommy told everyone that he was retired.
Healing the wounds of the heart takes time.
I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement.
Alex needs some alone time.
Alex isn't very clever.
Charlie told me he thought that Laur would be the next one to do that.
I don't think that Adam knows where Emma usually goes swimming.
Charlie read the letter a third time.
George should tell Eva to take her umbrella with her.
Alex, Margaret, John and Alice are all college students.
Forget about the past. Compared to yesterday, I like today more. That's why I try to enjoy the moment, that's all.
Alex has been trying to get Catherine out of prison for years.
I've never actually met her.
Charlie counted the stars in the sky.
Electric cars don't function as well in cold weather.
I didn't think Harry was last.
I barely know anything about you.
I love American food.
You two seem to get along well.
He moved from place to place.
I'm from Tokyo, Japan.
Did you put anything in the tea?
Don't send an email when you're feeling upset or angry.
It is exactly three o'clock now.
He seemed OK when I saw him.
I'm in bad shape.
We'll soon know the truth.
Joe is rich and powerful.
What was he arrested for this time?
I am just a nobody.
James tried to appear calm.
You're too kind.
She has to take her medication.
Jami heard a gunshot.
Charlie hid behind a tree.
Do you want to have lunch with me?
Harry told Mary that he thought John wasn't sincere.
I thought that you said you could speak French.
Can we go home?
Muhammad asked John to check to see if Julia was OK.
I don't feel like talking to anyone.
It's that time of the year.
Jack has lied to you.
Harry loved you.
He got wonderful results.
Catherine said that she's tired.
They know they won't get in trouble.
I wish I were still single.
That's what concerns me.
What time's your class?
Tell them to stop staring at us.
I don't have any way of getting hold of Jami.
What I did obviously didn't help.
Ken will be fifteen next year.
Alex helped Anna carry her bags.
Adam and Laur said they wished they hadn't done that by themselves.
How well do you sing?
Where've you been keeping yourselves?
Something terrible must've happened.
If you aren't feeling well, maybe you should rest in bed a little longer.
The doctor called him back.
He had the nerve to ask me to marry him.
The coffee pot is full of coffee.
I think Oliver is different.
Jami says he doesn't believe Carmen really did that by herself.
Alice has a dirty mind.
Jack should never have said that.
Joe is on his way to Australia, isn't he?
Let's not do that right now.
Do you think Jack and Julia will go to the dance together?
What could I say?
Adam says that Australia is a great place to live.
I can't sing as well as Lucy did.
You're pretty rich, aren't you?
William apparently wants to win.
Tommy isn't the only guy I've kissed.
Is Mary Jami's wife?
They had funny looks on their faces.
He dressed up and went to the kitchen.
I think Charlie and Catherine are innocent.
I have no friend to talk with.
She says she isn't lazy.
Why does George feel so lonely?
Even though it was very cold, we went out.
James didn't know he needed to do that.
Did Charlie mention any problems?
He was looking at her.
Jack has decided he wants to learn French.
I go by that shop every morning on my way to school.
Jacob was upset with Lucy.
Eva admitted she wasn't the one who actually did that.
I don't think Tommy and Catherine are finished doing that yet.
Charlie has moved away.
I wonder if James really knows how to speak French.
Try to have an open mind.
Alex's hat is red.
Clearly!
To talk with a lot of people is good for health.
William grew a little embarrassed.
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
Charlie told me that he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library.
There were times when I wished I were somewhere else.
I agree with them that we should try again.
Did you clean your room today?
How would you go about doing that?
She told me she likes Chinese food.
It's not as easy as George and Monica think.
Adam was the one who did that job.
Oliver planted some flower seeds in his garden.
She always takes her time in choosing her dress.
I've read a lot of books on that subject.
How did you live with James?
She looked a bit embarrassed.
Why do you want to know what we are thinking about?
At any rate, I did my duty.
We can't fail again.
She was afraid the letter might fall into the wrong hands.
Everything's better.
Let me in. I have to talk to you.
It may seem strange.
An injury is much sooner forgotten than an insult.
I live in a small apartment.
Muhammad is playing catch with his son.
Do you get your boss a Christmas gift?
I don't think anyone really thought Jack and Laur were busy.
You have to finish your homework right away.
I think that Joe wouldn't be here if he didn't think he could help us.
Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Do Joe and Anna know we can't take care of ourselves?
I don't think that I can wait until Harry gets here.
There's no money in my wallet.
I'm really looking forward to getting to know you better.
I don't think I have to read the instructions.
I want to see my parents.
I will hit the sack.
I've always wondered what it would be like to kiss him.
I'm the only one who's doing that.
The news was surprising.
He's on the honor roll.
I don't think that I've ever seen you so busy.
You should turn that off.
I was in Australia with them.
Tommy has a lot of friends in Boston.
He came to Rome to study Italian.
I decided to give Oscar another chance.
You're probably right.
When may I do that again?
A cat just came out of the basket.
Jacob said that he wanted to speak to the manager.
I see why you don't want to go there.
So much to do!
Why doesn't anybody believe us?
If they don't work, they don't get paid.
I wonder if Tommy really thinks I have to do that.
I know you helped us.
I was moved by this movie.
Jacob knew he should do that.
There were some flowers there.
I was in Australia most of last summer.
Adam said he thought Monica would probably be asleep by the time he got home.
Are you feeling confident?
I thought that James and Laur were twins.
Jack didn't have to explain it to me.
William moved closer to Monica.
William bought three tickets.
I can't find my bag.
George is broke.
Margaret thinks she's going to lose the race.
Did you like going to the library when you were a child?
She might've eaten on her way home.
I didn't wind the clock last night.
Don't you think this computer game may be a little too difficult for Adam?
Who is looking after the dog while you are away?
Adam will probably be up.
Charlie really has changed.
You're really good at that.
When I travel, I prefer to travel by air.
I'm incredibly tired.
Next week, we're going to buy a new car.
William came to Australia a lot last year.
Do Jacob and Valentina know that wish they'd leave?
William told me all about it.
We've got plenty.
Has anybody contacted Tommy?
I just have one problem left that I don't know how to solve.
I have to be there at 2:30.
When the thief heard the dog bark, he ran away.
He had no right to do what he did.
We tied him up so that he would not escape.
Does she sing?
Jacob always looks a bit tired.
Joe flew in from Australia this morning.
William and Monica claimed they waited until 2:30.
Jack obviously doesn't want it.
Maybe I should've done this sooner.
He often plays by himself.
I don't think anybody really thought Harry was happy.
Jack and Emma said they thought they heard voices in the next room.
Jacob doesn't want to become a voice actor.
Alex goes out drinking every weekend.
I tried to help Alex decide what to do.
Adam must've wanted to do that.
I love French films.
That couldn't be more wrong.
I haven't seen the film. Don't spoil it for me!
Monica's husband would probably leave her if he knew the truth.
He hasn't done his homework.
Joe said that Laur knew John might not want to do that with her.
Harry doesn't trust them.
I don't have as much money as James.
We make a really good team.
I'm e-mailing to follow up on our phone conversation this morning.
Monica wants you to help her wash windows.
Oscar has been studying French for the last three years.
George and Mary don't want to study French, but they have to.
You're expected to win.
Alice said she hopes George can win.
Let's get inside.
Jacob reached for his rifle.
Coffee will be served after the meal.
Tell me what your name is.
I know that Alex didn't know that you shouldn't have been doing that.
Alex said that he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
She thought that John had loved her.
I thought that might happen.
Harry and I'll be in the lobby waiting for you.
Help me move the couch.
Never in my life have I thought of leaving the town.
I don't think Muhammad has time to buy everything he needs to buy.
He is the champion.
May I use your pen?
Should I help Charlie with his homework?
Tell me when to start.
Valentina says she doesn't think that we should even consider doing that.
What's Harry listening to?
Do you have any more of these?
This box will serve as a chair.
I think both Oscar and Carmen want to come with us.
Would you please stop following me?
Jacob said that Alice isn't going to eat with us today.
He showed up at my front door.
You wanna throw down?
She said that she was very grateful.
Harry turned on the desk lamp and started working.
I'm OK.
I will call you without fail.
We'll have to be careful.
That's not so important.
We don't drink enough water.
George and Valentina didn't actually want to do that, did they?
Are you sure Jack and Anna aren't busy?
The restaurant is empty.
But he likes the long school holidays.
I helped Alex and Laur with their work.
I'll go and get you a doctor.
He said he'd like to go with us.
William refuses to take orders from Eva.
Can anyone read this message for me? I don't understand English.
Harry is helpless.
Did you notice that girl at all?
Jami isn't going to let Olivia go to the party.
Tommy didn't know that you wanted to go fishing with him.
He is in the kitchen.
Oliver has a longer beard than John does.
We're going to a new bar tonight. Do you want to come along?
I don't think that Jacob knows why Alice and John are arguing.
I feel lighter than air.
I forgot to do something that needed to be done.
She still has to pack her suitcase.
He doesn't know who he should ask.
We expect Harry to leave on Monday.
Give her a doll.
Figured it's the least I could do.
Adam said that Alice knew John might not want to do that by himself.
I think that William is good-looking.
We need experts.
Charlie has a lot of teaching experience.
I was surprised when Jack told me he wanted to do that.
William said he couldn't swim well.
Charlie and Valentina told me that they were headed home.
I know that Oliver is skinny.
I have a problem remembering people's names.
It will pay you to study hard.
Where are you all going so early in the morning?
You and Jack agree, don't you?
They told me that they could get us what we wanted.
Jack and Alice told me they can't speak French.
He looks like he's about to cry.
I'll be ready in just a minute.
Soft music often helps you fall sleep.
My dog is pretty smart.
I want to be alone!
It's a good thing you know how to speak French.
Oliver needed some time to think things over.
Here's a letter from him.
Muhammad said he wouldn't forget that night.
I'm going to be in Australia all summer.
Where is Rome?
Oliver and Olivia are doing everything they can.
He said to me, 'Let's play catch.'
They are leaving for London.
It can't take much longer.
I'm not her friend.
Monica said she would go to Boston.
That's fine by me.
I just can't get along with James.
Someone will have to tell George eventually.
I hope something bad doesn't happen to us.
We're going back to Australia this summer.
She regrets having been rude to you.
Both of my brothers are older than me.
George said that he didn't like Eva's dress.
I think that William would be willing to go with us.
I thought that Adam didn't like it.
I think Jack forgot to tell Monica what to do.
She looked like she was relieved.
Come and fight with us.
What else did he say?
Harry's body hasn't been found.
You'll read it another day.
Have you ever shot a rifle?
Harry told me that he's shy.
I didn't know Charlie knew why you didn't do that.
We've never seen things like this before, and so it's happening again!
These letters reveal her to be an honest lady.
I hardly know you.
Alice knows she has to be ready.
Did George and Emma say they thought they had to do that?
I wanted to ask Tommy to do that.
James paid off his credit card debt.
It is a sacred right.
Oscar is a chemical engineer.
They're not ashamed of what they did.
You were with me on that night.
Throw out your weapon.
I didn't know that's what we should have been doing.
I'm not very good at dealing with these kinds of situations.
The evidence doesn't support the claim.
James didn't think Margaret would permit him to do that.
It will cost how much it costs.
Hurry up, will you?
You're welcome.
It's hard doing that every day.
Tommy seemed to be worried about Anna.
Knowledge makes us free and better people.
What she bought there was a camera.
She lost her new watch.
Can you tell me if this is true?
Emma said she'll look after me.
You'll meet someone else.
They knew that they'd be punished.
How did you know that I was going to say that?
I suspected something like this might happen.
Charlie is expected to do that, isn't he?
I had a good time today.
Eva didn't do what Jacob asked her to do.
They walked side-by-side.
I wish there had been something like this when I was a kid.
James had to admit Julia was right.
They removed their gloves.
Get away from that door.
She said that the heat bothered her.
I'm very worried about James.
The desk Ken uses is old.
In total there are 9 people in my family.
It was very hard to swim across the river.
Where did you all go for New Year's Eve?
I have my reasons.
On the evening of our arrival we were sitting in the Colonel's gun-room after dinner.
We fell for each other immediately.
Charlie has decided he's had enough.
What time did William say he wanted to get there?
Be careful not to burn the roof of your mouth.
It's a big responsibility.
Alice told me I was like a son to her.
Jacob thinks that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I hope you're careful.
James said that his bus was late.
Fill this out.
I go to the library at least once a week.
She tried to write a short story.
Sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same thing.
I love cake.
I don't believe that your name is really Jack.
Oscar lied to me and so did Mary.
I'll give these books to anybody wants them.
Olivia said that she'd like to do that.
Tommy said that he won't help Lucy anymore.
You knew George should do that, didn't you?
Alex should tell Laur what he wants to do.
You like him and he likes you.
Oliver and Laur tried to tell John what they were planning to do.
I don't know who that is.
We've never lied to each other.
Jacob is in the prime of his life.
Alex had no idea that Julia couldn't speak French at all.
Jami may be able to answer the question.
I know that Muhammad doesn't know where we did that.
I have things to do.
I think Tommy and Julia have both already agreed to do that.
I'm sorry for lying about that.
We'll review everything.
I have wanted to be a painter for a long time.
Margaret isn't just my boss. She's my friend, too.
I found the work easy, for I had done that kind of work before.
Adam and Valentina told me they've decided to do that.
I thought that things were going OK.
How did work go?
I don't have a phone right now.
He established his son in trade.
I suggest you don't ask Adam so many questions next time.
Harry asked me who painted this picture.
James said that Emma was deaf.
Do you want to know what it means?
In cookies, he only eats the filling.
We've got to go and help her.
Harry was unbelievable.
You should let James know you can drive.
Most people would survive.
It feels safe here.
Jami says he wants to walk home.
It doesn't matter whether you come or not.
I can't imagine living like that.
I'm not having dinner with you.
I know why Jami and Eva weren't supposed to do that.
William wasn't polite.
Yell.
No one could guess why that thing had happened to him.
This is for everybody.
I got sucked into it.
Jack is in a very good mood.
He needs to lower his standards.
Even Joe and Olivia don't go to Boston anymore.
Harry hasn't yet promised me that he'd do that.
You liked that movie, didn't you?
My father, who is very busy, has no time to read books.
A careful observation will show you the difference.
I don't feel anything at all.
I just want to try it on.
Oscar always gets what he wants.
I had no idea James knew how to speak French.
Do you read lips?
Bill was in Japan.
The workers began a sit-down strike in front of the factory.
Together they had eight children.
Their claims were as follows.
I made very few mistakes.
We've got to get Jacob to a hospital.
What kind of work does Jami want to do?
Margaret shut off her computer.
I don't plan to do that when Alex and Monica are around.
Adam should've done that already.
Charlie is no longer a student.
Harry dropped out of college and became a millionaire.
If Alice had a lot of money, she'd do that.
Why didn't you ever tell me how you felt about me?
I'd like to see you.
I'll prove it to you.
I can't believe he did that!
We'll never get there in time.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
There was no one on the other end of the line.
That tree is red.
I met Tommy in October.
It took me several hours to finish it.
Margaret admitted she was nervous.
Adam was there, wasn't he?
Lock up your passport.
I went to the woman myself and told her about it, and she said that she also wanted to tell her daughter.
They may leave if they want to.
That doesn't really seem appropriate right now.
Joe must have thought Valentina already knew how to do that.
The street was crowded with cars.
My heart is at peace.
I should be with Joe.
They would have got a better exchange rate if they had gone to a bank.
I still want to speak French.
Jami and Mary have both never done that.
I'm going to advise you to just listen now.
Jacob said that he doesn't think that Laur knows how to do that very well.
Could you show me how to start this machine?
He answered my questions by the exercise of his excellent memory.
I'm in charge of shopping.
I never had much money.
Nothing can happen to you.
I'm only pulling your leg.
How often do you ride a bicycle?
Is that what you'd like?
I should've waited until October to come back to Australia.
A sea of words, but only a drop of sense.
Oscar said that Julia didn't agree to do that.
I get that lot.
He's crazy.
I wanted to make a few phone calls.
I'm looking for ways to save on electricity.
Your meal is ready.
The girl I told you about is from Boston.
I looked everywhere.
Where did George get his money?
Why not just ask them to leave?
I don't blame Adam one bit.
It's warm.
There is no smoking here.
It's either us or them.
We know that a cat, whose eyes take in much more light than human eyes, can see clearly at night.
That looks really good.
They look like they're sick.
It's nice you found a girlfriend.
He said he wouldn't speak French.
Tommy said that he thought Lucy would be afraid.
Zip it.
We should keep ourselves clean.
Oscar became a father in October.
Joe almost never eats dessert.
So what's it like?
Don't say anything without thinking.
I knew Jack was planning to do that today.
Joe didn't want to talk.
They're going to hang Muhammad.
Aren't you supposed to be on a diet?
Tommy gained nothing by doing that.
Does Jami still have that red sports car he used to drive?
We could do a lot if we stood together.
That's not a shame.
Don't believe her, Olivia.
Oscar had a date with Carmen last Monday evening.
I don't necessarily have to go.
Oscar was the only one who didn't know Mary had moved to Boston.
Oscar wrote Eva a love letter.
You smell incredible.
Who's coming for supper?
There was much activity around the plane.
What were you telling them?
I wish I could study French.
Let me check your blood pressure.
You're hard to please.
Not driving himself, he isn't familiar with cars.
Oliver looked like he was certain.
She pressed her nose against the sheet of glass.
We have lots of other things to drink.
Fear not because there is nothing to fear.
James and Valentina locked themselves in their room.
Where's this club?
Thank you for dealing with this problem on time.
The story of the lost prince was a fiction.
It doesn't end well.
He may do that himself.
You're wet through.
Alex will definitely come.
I really didn't want to play tag with Harry and his friends.
We're dealing with that problem.
Let's hope we find something.
Oscar must have found out about the party from Emma.
Oscar got wet to the skin.
I didn't read the book my teacher told me to read.
I almost forgot to do my homework.
Wipe your mouths.
I wonder if we're safe.
Jack is going to apologize.
I'm faster.
Just tell me what you'd like me to do.
Do you have any objection to this plan?
Does James know about Margaret?
I know you can help us.
The US used to murder a lot of people because of their color; now we just murder a lot. Shit, we went the wrong way.
I had to walk here because my car broke down.
Alex is waiting for some of his friends to join him.
Charlie isn't wrong about that, but he's wrong about everything else.
You probably think I'm crazy.
I thought you wanted to watch that movie.
Emma told me that she thought Boston wasn't as safe as it used to be.
Oh, Jacob, it's just wonderful!
My room has only one window.
I thought you said that you didn't like to do that.
Who wants to take Oscar home?
Mary said she won't forget that night.
I think something's wrong.
Oliver said that Margaret should never have done that.
Do you know how long it takes to fly from Boston to Chicago?
They lay down.
I've already done what needs to be done.
This is me, I'm eating a banana.
Sorry, something went wrong.
I know I shouldn't have told Catherine she had to do that.
Alex and Monica ate dinner by themselves.
Oscar and Mary said they didn't want to do that because it was dangerous.
I usually shower at night.
What did the announcement just say?
Muhammad has money.
Monica must've traveled a lot when she was younger.
The soldier was killed in action.
How often does Muhammad take French lessons?
The weather being fine, we went on a picnic.
Charlie doesn't think he really needs to do that.
Olivia said she'd rather not spend much time doing that.
Alex shouldn't tell Susie what he did.
I thought that it worked nicely.
What food are you best at cooking?
George and Emma are good at their jobs.
I think it might be foolish to do that.
James was in court on Monday.
They're going to Boston.
We don't need any more time.
Carmen said she didn't want to hang out with Oscar anymore.
George wasn't here either.
The shop where I bought the ring is closed today.
She thought that she saw a pattern.
There were no problems to report.
I should have warned you earlier.
This is the best money can buy.
Did Alex tell you we were coming?
Of course, I told them.
There's nothing over there.
When I got home, James was asleep on the front porch.
I suspect Tommy is lying.
I didn't think anybody suspected you weren't Jacob.
Try and calm down.
I just don't want to do it again.
He killed the mood last time with his jokes.
It's very complicated.
Joe looks like his grandfather.
How do you think Tommy and Laur were able to win?
Harry didn't know what he had to do.
Why would you want to hurt her?
Don't turn your back on her.
You've been keeping something from me.
Jacob's home and office were searched by the police.
Alex was doing that yesterday.
Harry kept his word.
Berlin is the largest city in Germany.
Harry seems to be reliable.
I have a good appetite this morning.
I'll see you in a few days.
I can't believe that Oscar said that.
She sells vegetables.
I want this photograph developed as soon as possible.
I wonder if Jami will insist we do that.
India has a different climate from England.
You are not dumb.
Do you know whose this is?
All the old magazines have been sold.
What's up with her?
James began to say something.
Do you think she still loves my letters?
I told George that I'd be late.
I don't let people I don't know into my house.
She likes to smoke tobacco.
Oscar sells cars in Boston.
I think we made a sale.
They're different.
Jack said that he's always been interested in sports.
You had a stroke, didn't you?
Let's rent a bike there.
I've been calling Adam and Anna all morning, but I can't get a hold of them.
Did you remember to tell Tommy and Eva what I asked you to tell them?
Tips aren't included.
William didn't want to buy Olivia a present.
George is concerned about it, too.
He is the greatest singer that ever lived.
It was not clear what she really meant.
In my opinion, it would be difficult to solve this problem.
I just couldn't sleep.
Jack is going to be back on October 20th.
I don't work in Australia.
My heart sings to see you.
Tommy left for Boston.
He's just a know-all.
Wait till I tell Harry before you tell Julia.
Tommy is at home with the flu.
It looks like Jami is afraid.
Adam buried himself under his blanket.
Harry is working at his desk.
The exam results were not what she expected.
We were on the same bus.
I told Charlie to speak French.
Valentina put a towel on Jami's forehead.
Alex said that he wasn't interested in doing that.
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.
As you already know.
Harry wrapped both his arms around her shoulders.
I'm older than you may think.
Which one of these boys will you give the book to?
Oliver and I live across the street from each other.
I don't have an opportunity to get a new car.
It'll be a busy day.
Some people come into your life as blessings, others, as lessons.
Of course I will be a good student.
Let's pretend we didn't hear that.
Just check it.
William says he didn't know Anna wanted to eat pizza.
Adam said he wasn't exactly sure what to do.
He sounds disappointed.
Oscar is not allowed in the lab.
I've always been delighted with the chinese culture.
I don't think that James knows exactly what needs to be done.
Which one was it?
Because of the thick fog, we could not see the signs clearly.
My cousin took me by surprise by coming without previous notice.
She said that she found her keys.
Which ice cream shop are you going to?
How many sandwiches did Charlie and Eva make?
What's with the outfit?
I didn't know Adam would ask Anna to help him.
I'm winning.
James tried to catch the rabbit.
I'll have to check with her.
I study medicine.
I'm not going to your house.
He will be able to hand in his report tomorrow.
One of the things Jacob and Alice enjoy doing is swimming.
Muhammad wondered who Laur had invited to her party.
I'd rather live in a wooden house.
Charlie has been drinking, but he isn't drunk.
We don't belong here.
Alex really loves going to work.
I couldn't let her go.
Hold your tongue!
I take a lot of pictures.
I wonder why Adam left.
You and I need to talk about this.
I'm pretty sure that Muhammad is on campus.
Your skirt is way too short.
It looks like rain. We should close the windows.
Alex didn't tell us what time he planned to get there.
He is not at all a gentleman.
James is probably stuck in traffic.
Adam took an interest in Julia.
Jami, Julia, John and Alice all did that.
He said he hopes you'll help him.
Lucy says she plans to win.
Mary really looks pretty.
Harry could've called the police.
I'm certain Oliver will want to speak with you.
I'm afraid that's no longer possible.
I suspected Harry was unhappy.
Harry's song was a huge success.
Whether it will rain or not, the game is going to be held.
Joe is turning thirty.
I don't think that Tommy knows where the post office is.
I actually did that by myself.
The rock flew through the open window.
We are faced with a host of problems.
I knew that Oscar was a ballet dancer.
Adam told Susie he was sorry.
Where is my watch?
Keep off my property.
Jami and Emma say they'll hurt me.
He didn't say anything about himself.
I always go home for lunch.
Our school administration decided to do away with that school rule.
I'm at ease in English.
I would take French, for choice.
I thought that you said you've only tried doing that once.
Did you tell Harry what you were hired to do?
Did you see anybody there?
William invited Laur to stay for dinner.
This is Jack's wife.
No one was alive.
I had my shoes cleaned.
I don't think Emma would be here if she didn't need to be.
Don't trust anybody.
Neither Joe nor Catherine can cook very well.
I definitely needed a plan.
Where did you park the car?
The flowers give off a very pleasant perfume.
That is why he was late for school.
There's no explanation for what happened to Oliver.
Tommy and Lucy said that they're through doing that.
Alex said that he would leave at 2:30.
Tommy has been arrested again.
Jami didn't have any choice.
She has sail-like ears.
You should have been a farmer.
I don't know what to do about this difficult problem.
I think that was very special.
Kill all the survivors.
Adam is busy writing the report now.
He went to stay at his client's house.
They are all so much alike that I can't tell which is which.
Muhammad used to follow Margaret around like a puppy dog.
Jami doesn't want to be in Boston anymore.
They look older than they really are.
They said they'd buy what was needed.
I have three brothers who used to work in Boston.
Be more careful, or you will make mistakes.
Alex said I wasn't allowed to do that.
Now I'm going to tell you how it is.
Jack didn't want to tell anyone where he'd been.
I think Harry can speak French.
The girls came dancing arm in arm.
Oscar and Laur know John is smart.
Jacob hasn't fed the dog yet.
Why should I care about him?
Jami and I were both impressed.
One stayed and the other went away.
Jack called Catherine a liar.
Jami handed a set of keys to Olivia.
Charlie should have understood the rules.
Joe didn't know why Julia was mad.
I told you to leave him alone.
I don't associate with those people.
We're very happy together.
Adam said he's glad Anna didn't get hurt.
I know Alex and Carmen both have to leave soon.
I really want to be with Alex right now.
Charlie didn't do it every night.
William is the one who's supposed to be doing that.
Oscar said that he thought that Olivia would unlikely do that.
Tommy said that he didn't know what to do next.
You'll have to move.
Costs were through the roof.
William couldn't come because he was sick.
Tommy is quite generous.
He couldn't carry out his first plan.
Carmen doesn't know exactly what she needs to do.
I think that car over there is Muhammad's.
Adam asked Alice to buy some eggs on her way home.
The tower stood among ruins.
We ate until we were satisfied.
Charlie lives on an island.
It is said that Tokyo is a very safe city.
I wanted to lie, but I didn't.
We'll go talk to Adam.
The photo brought back many happy memories of my childhood.
The train will pick up speed in a minute.
I say what other people won't.
Jack's desk is perfectly clean.
He killed that man.
Oscar doesn't know how to speak to children.
And you know what ? We're done !
James said that he was waiting for something to happen.
Oliver should have never said that.
William and Valentina are getting ready to go.
How's the weather today?
We met last year in Boston.
I looked him straight in the eye.
Joe, we've never been too close, have we?
I can't do this by myself.
I'd like to volunteer to go with Muhammad.
I know James knew that Eva had never done that before.
You are much too modest.
I was afraid I might be too tired to help.
Good morning, how are you doing?
George said Mary may do that.
I'll stay and watch them.
Charlie died in 2013 of liver failure.
Come back in two days.
Bob, help me carry his suitcase to the living room.
Adam didn't like our decision.
The soup I had was so hot I couldn't drink it.
Hey! I'm about to get angry!
Do you have a tattoo?
He said, "Leave me alone."
Do you know the name of this flower?
I know that I'm a bad dancer.
Who smashed the window? Tell me the truth.
Charlie and Margaret say they don't think John really knows how to do that.
Alex told me about it himself.
I'd like to know what's going to happen here this afternoon.
They admitted they were hungry.
That was Tommy's fault.
Bing-bong ... bing-bong ... "Oh-oh. The class bell!"
We're stubborn.
Good morning, Mike.
What if someone sees us?
They never told me they were engaged.
What do you wanna eat?
They said that they thought you'd win.
I managed not to come even one night.
I think he must go there.
Jack and Susie wished they'd never asked John to do that.
When did you work in Boston?
It has to be done.
He will go swimming, whether you go with him or stay at home.
He is no longer here.
We're just talking.
Tommy said that he'd consider doing that.
Oscar looked at me as if I were out of my mind.
Would you just shut up?
She explained her problem.
Those brothers are both over 6 feet in height. That's indeed tall.
Everyone but Oliver seemed to enjoy the party.
I'm a fan like everybody else.
Joe is sound asleep in bed.
The reason Harry came was because Carmen asked him to.
Adam and Mary said that they didn't smoke.
We need more options.
I can't help being worried.
Why don't you use your language?
I'd like to come to see the doctor as soon as possible.
That's why we're sitting here.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on.
Do you trust anyone?
Muhammad was the first one to get here.
Doing that is a lot easier than it looks.
Do you really have to tell them?
The plan was a good one apart from its cost.
Did you say anything to them?
Please fold your clothes.
He is sure of winning.
I will call you in an hour.
I wonder whether William and Emma are sleeping.
William asked Margaret if she was nervous.
Susie is a very hard worker, isn't she?
I don't like talking to strangers.
Instead of going to Boston next summer, let's go to Chicago.
We really hope that you can come.
I'll bet that I can beat you to the tree.
Somebody has to hurry and quickly drive her to the hospital.
You know that that isn't likely to happen, don't you?
James was worried, but Margaret wasn't.
Adam and I weren't invited.
I'd like to get information regarding a number of questions.
They were supposed to have gotten married in May, but they didn't.
I never really trusted them.
Why didn't you come to yesterday's party?
Do you think that I'm funny?
She's a clever girl.
You're very early.
Jacob cried himself to sleep every night last week.
Alex was lucky to have had help doing that.
We have to go on.
It was hard for me to do that by myself.
What do you think of the new movie?
You aren't in trouble, are you?
I hear that Jack isn't in Australia now.
Mary kept her eyes shut.
Alex is wearing a cast on his arm.
I know I'll be able to do that by 2:30.
I suspect that Oscar will come to Boston.
I would never do it that way.
We have lots of bread, and as for butter, we have more than enough.
Deal me out.
Because she felt sick.
Is she here yet?
They might take the car.
I was convinced that I was right.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
He likes to live in Tokyo.
Your elder brother is doing his homework, you can only play!
She returned to her hotel room.
Like will to like.
I never saw the like of it before.
The same thing is happening here in Boston.
I heard that Jack and Olivia are going to do that.
Was my letter sent?
Muhammad didn't believe what Valentina told him.
She says she can't sing.
Today I want to eat something light.
You must not get drowned in your sake.
It wasn't me. It was the cat.
Everyone in the class is here today.
I do remember it.
The rules require us all to be present.
I wonder what they're laughing about.
You refused to answer my questions.
Some things in life are beyond our ability to control.
We can still learn a lot from Harry.
He said that he feels fine.
Should he see you, he would be surprised.
It's obvious that Muhammad doesn't want to talk about it.
We just weren't meant to be together.
Oliver doesn't know where he is.
He isn't sure how he got here.
He insulted me without reason.
Alex is at home with Mary.
I should do what Jack and Olivia are doing.
Adam tried to do it by himself.
Emma is quite young, isn't she?
I know George knows that he'll never be able to do that.
Jami isn't very organized.
Let's hope Tommy doesn't write a book.
There's a pool table in Jami's basement.
Tell your mother-in-law not to phone me here any more.
I didn't practice the piano yesterday.
Which do you prefer, rice or bread?
I don't need that kind of help.
Is Jacob still doing his homework?
We are trying to keep the wolf from the door.
Jack and Laur assured me that they wouldn't do that again.
He said that the matter was urgent, and that there was not a moment to lose.
Even then we might not make it.
I've never hit anyone.
Why do we need to find her?
You're right, no doubt about it.
You can stay here if you like.
I wonder when we'll see each other again.
How do you know it'll be terrible?
Does loyalty even exist anymore?
George doesn't think Catherine is bored.
Tickets are available online.
I want to spend time with Oscar.
What's this zoo's name?
Oliver noticed that Anna was following him.
Margaret packed her suitcase.
We came on foot.
To wherever the wind may take us.
Charlie is a good choice.
He's a big boy.
Tommy is washing your car.
It should be no problem.
They took away my daughter.
If you are happy, I am happy.
Jack said that he'd never seen anything like that before.
Oliver is still not ready.
She backed up her data.
Tommy and Laur are likely to be very hungry when they get home.
I met her here.
I told him the bank was closed.
The meeting is to be held here tomorrow.
William said that he was in Boston now.
Susie knew she'd probably said too much.
I think of her day and night.
I stayed with Jami.
I think that Oliver is afraid of you.
Let's keep an eye on that.
That's a problem we have to solve as soon as possible.
How many people were aboard that ship?
It looks like things aren't working out between us, so I think that we need to take a break.
Eva said she didn't learn anything at school today.
Food, clothing and shelter are the basis of life.
You seemed surprised when Tommy told me you didn't have to do that.
Don't make sport of me.
I had no sooner left the house than it began to rain hard.
Tommy is playing bass guitar.
William said that he was told to do that by himself.
Do that, OK?
George eats lunch near the office where he works.
The problem is that Valentina thinks she's better than George.
You didn't want Jack to die, did you?
Adam is waiting for his manager.
Belief is the death of intelligence.
I know that Adam won't likely do that today.
You never expected Harry to refuse to do that, did you?
Lucy is counting on us, isn't she?
Alex reported Catherine missing.
I realized that I didn't want to spend any more time dealing with that problem.
Oscar and Eva are happy.
You look as if you've lost your best friend.
We could've died.
Harry handled that well.
What do you suppose this is?
I don't accept your excuse.
I don't want what happened to me to happen to Adam.
Jack and Valentina said they wanted to help us do that.
Monica knows what she wants to say.
It looks like Harry is doing that.
I had intended to call on her last Sunday.
I just touched a snake.
I'm on vacation, too.
George said Emma may win.
Charlie seemed to take the matter seriously.
Our university has a good library.
Have you tried talking to her?
She's her sweater on inside out.
I read the note.
Harry and Alice said they could probably do that.
You're in the wrong century.
The wicked witch pushed her into the deep water.
I ate a hot dog for lunch.
Alex and Mary said they were trying to stay awake.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
The most comfortable time of every day is spent lying on the bed.
Would you mind telling me who you're waiting for?
To begin with, she is too young.
Who would do this?
All Jacob wants to do is swim.
If I were you, I'd think twice before going down that path.
Where's the proof William ever did that?
George and Laur said they didn't know anyone here.
Find Charles and kill him.
Muhammad took his son John to a baseball game.
Children don't keep still.
I really hope that happens.
Jami has been to Australia.
How many years have you been a student here?
I forgot all about them.
He often breaks his promises.
We got three times as many people as we expected.
Will you be eating here or is this to go?
I want you to tell me everything you know about what's happening.
Muhammad has two children.
Muhammad began to remove his gloves.
George found me a French teacher.
Jack needs to get ready for school.
His cottage is on the coast.
Where's your bedroom?
Do you know what's in the box?
There is a monster under my bed.
It's a few minutes before three o'clock.
Oliver doubts that he'll be able get there on time.
Jacob can tell you more about that than I can.
It sounds like George won't be here tomorrow.
"What are you hiding behind your back?" "Nothing."
I could be correct.
You're the only person I know here who can do that.
She is willing to do odd jobs.
The plane will take off in one hour.
He only had one thing in mind.
I'll let Jami go.
It was pouring rain all morning long.
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
I owe my success to my friends.
I know I might not be allowed to do that.
When he was young, he was the talk of town.
Adam gave Carmen a huge kiss.
Do you want my email address?
I will tell you what I saw.
I really wish I knew what James plans to do.
I'll phone her tonight.
Monica told Oliver that she didn't think John was bored.
Tommy was the one that won.
It is very important for us to love a river.
I knew that Alex would be allowed to do what he wanted to do.
Alex will probably be afraid of Anna's dog.
Jami said he didn't know why Lucy didn't like John.
Let's allow Jami to do that.
The question is why not.
Did that surprise you?
They said that they're hungry.
Who else would want to do that?
I got tired very fast.
Jami was nice to everyone.
I want you to do that by yourselves.
Mary hoped Oliver could help her.
She found herself a mother at fifteen.
You ought to tell George to do that.
I'm going to check my calendar.
Charlie made me something to eat.
I don't leave money lying around.
Please make it happen.
I can not trust this man.
You are taught to never question your teachers.
I also went there.
I don't know if this is true.
Adam will be unable to do that in an hour.
Do you want to do something else?
I thought you said you were planning on doing that.
It must have happened that way.
You really should've told George and Julia that they didn't have to come.
Charlie kept looking at Anna.
She will love her husband for good.
Oscar isn't as old as he looks.
I'd rather not be busy.
Adam is on the swimming team.
The actor looked his part.
We cannot thank you too much for your help.
Charlie collapsed to the ground.
Let him take a look at it.
It seems as if you are the first one here.
We elected him captain of our team.
I'm still not very good at chess.
This is a bow for a strong person.
Catherine lost her hearing aid.
I won't eat anything.
Tell James he has to leave.
I wonder where Tommy and Emma usually go shopping.
Your muscles are very tense.
Now, the situation is better.
I hope that Joe and Olivia like the present I bought for them.
James said goodbye to Monica at the door.
I don't want anybody talking about me.
Put down your pencil.
Their goods are of the highest quality.
Charlie said that he was going to let us do that.
I need a new pen. I'll buy one.
You will soon come to like this town.
Yes, please.
We'll meet him tomorrow.
I don't need it now.
It's as if we had lost our identity.
Jack didn't want to talk about that.
I already knew that she had become engaged.
I often think about my deceased mother.
Joe said that he wanted to go to Australia.
Her bag was very heavy because it was full of thick books.
Did I catch you at a bad time?
He never told me why he was here.
There was a half-eaten pizza on the table.
We didn't break in.
She went on laughing and dancing with the thought of death all the time in her heart.
That's all George ever talks about.
It's not going to be a problem.
I want to know what it is first.
Alice told him.
I doubt that Alex has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
Charlie hasn't yet returned to Australia.
I have one brother and two sisters.
You are so cruel to make me decide whom to go there.
Would you like to go on a trip with me?
Aren't you excited?
I want to give you a hug.
Jami could tell by the look on Julia's face that she was very excited.
I'll wash the apple.
Out of the two, I choose the less expensive one.
Once you're in, you can't get out.
George says he's dying.
That hardly matters anymore.
James said that Carmen is very tired.
She misses her father.
Do what James and Emma tell you to do.
I got nervous when I saw a police car following me.
You have to reply to the letter.
She was not at all upset by the news.
I'm pretty sure that Adam is the only one who doesn't need to do that.
Muhammad probably doesn't have enough time to do that.
Joe is sick in bed, isn't he?
Do either of you know a guy named Muhammad Jackson?
He has a headache.
See you at the office.
Adam has a habit of losing his temper.
The mountain path was under a blanket of leaves, soft and easy to walk on.
I've said it before and I'm saying it again: don't touch my things!
William asked me to buy some rope.
Harry and Olivia returned to their hotel rooms.
His story sounds strange.
She told me that she had a knife.
I wish you'd do that for me.
What's so weird about this?
I know that Tommy might be able to do that.
Oliver will have a lot of help.
I'll hide and you find me. OK?
He decided to abandon law for art.
William appears to be strong and healthy.
I'm sure Adam doesn't want to be in Australia next Monday.
Julia realized she didn't have to do that anymore.
William and Valentina wanted to start their own business.
I worked hard to succeed.
It's bad for the heart.
Charlie reminded me to pay my bills.
Jack doesn't even want to do that anymore.
Oscar's dog ran away.
I'm looking forward to tomorrow night.
I never know what you boys are up to.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was that serious.
I don't know what we will do.
William said Margaret wanted him to do that for her.
I never had time to get scared.
I didn't have much money.
Go get yourself some sleep.
I think I'll give this car a go.
Dan knew what he was looking for.
Harry wasn't very impressed.
We're crazy about each other.
Jacob didn't want to call attention to himself.
He has never spoken with your supervisor since the day that he was hired.
The mayor provided me with an identity card.
Don't touch me.
The average American living space is twice as large as the living space in Japan.
You've definitely gotten better at French.
Do you really think I want to do what I do?
Harry and Catherine said that they're glad you won.
Without water, nothing could live on this earth.
You only believe in people who believe in themselves.
I heard someone call my name.
Jack and Catherine look as if they're drunk.
Jack said that he thought that he wouldn't be able to cheer Alice up.
When exactly do you have to do that?
I think we shouldn't help Harry.
He married a girl of his own choice.
They have their children with them.
I want to do some shopping around here.
We stayed home for Christmas, so as to avoid heavy traffic.
That's what matters.
I'll give you a check.
Harry and Olivia wouldn't be stupid enough to do that, would they?
Tommy seemed surprised when Susie told him that she didn't want to do that.
I'm afraid we'll get nowhere doing it this way.
Adam didn't like that place.
Allow me to kiss you again.
No one believed you.
I didn't feel like buying a car.
Joe is a little weird, isn't he?
Eva cared for the sick and the poor.
Five hundred years ago it was a house.
Let's all think on this together and we might be able to come up with some good ideas. They say two heads are better than one.
Joe and Mary have told John not to park his car in front of their house.
He went to Paris at the end of May.
How do you know that that's where George is now?
I'd like to make a call to Japan.
There's been a lot of rain this year.
Harry locked his keys in the car.
I haven't known the fact up to now.
There's little hope that he'll succeed.
Shall I go for a walk?
I've already picked out the CD I'm going to buy next.
Olivia realized James wasn't talking to her.
I'm coming in July.
Paper is useful for writing.
You are going home.
I knew then and there that I could never get along with Charlie.
James and Valentina looked like they were depressed.
Would you rather I didn't help?
Alex still can't get Susie out of his head.
You really are strong.
I meant to ask you a question in the meeting but I missed out.
You should know!
Do you really want to know if Harry and Olivia like you?
I came to this restaurant for the fish.
Jami is going to put his dog to sleep.
Oscar probably thought that I liked Australia.
Let me make a trip over there.
Julia wondered what she could do.
He said he won't walk home today.
I knew that Charlie might need to do that this week.
He said he didn't want to die.
Catherine is really younger than she looks.
We managed to cook more than a thousand chickens in one day.
Nobody can live to be two hundred years old.
All you should do is follow his advice.
I know your numbers.
I had no idea what I should do.
Harry left something behind.
What's wrong with you, George?
Emma says she definitely won't do that today.
You have enough candy to last until next year.
We're sold out of jeans.
Tell me what to do.
I hope that I get the chance to go to Boston.
I'll show you my new car.
Why aren't Joe and Laur ever interested in anything I do?
He didn't even try.
The doctor came into the examination room and asked about her problem.
I think that Adam wasn't telling the truth.
I don't think it'll take long for me to fix that.
That sounds okay.
William seemed to be inspired.
It might not be a coincidence.
She told me all about her family.
The image of my mother is on my mind.
Being fat is a serious problem for me.
Jami speaks French, and so does Catherine.
He tried to open the box in vain.
They have to study hard for the math test.
Alex has been a basketball coach for a long time.
When did you start writing songs?
I recognize that person from somewhere.
I wonder why Tommy and Julia weren't here yesterday.
Maybe it wasn't him.
Alex said that he was looking for help.
Can you give us some tips on buying a car?
I want to go to town.
I think that I'm going to have to tell William everything.
It was very naughty of Jacob to do that.
Adam will come at 2:30.
She came here to ask us to help her.
We talked in low voices so we wouldn't wake the baby.
What's he up to?
I would have done that if I'd had the chance to.
Let's hope that Adam can handle that by himself.
People in general have faith in everything newspapers say.
Jack is a charming man.
What has he done to us?
My children like Jell-O.
William said that he thought it would be better if Julia didn't do that.
Do you think we convinced them?
I reckon we'll see him once more.
You should run for president.
Muhammad and Emma work in the same department.
Is there a place I can smoke?
Harry is a true champion.
I didn't know anything about that.
I'm not going to tell you how to live your life.
I sat by myself.
It's time I got revenge. Now I will kill you!
Jack and Susie never had a chance, did they?
I can't afford a new car this year.
Are you sure this is where we're supposed to turn?
That's not what I want to buy.
The possibility William might do that worried Susie.
We are looking forward to hearing from you soon.
The boss said it's urgent!
I thought that you might actually do that.
William seemed to be leaving.
Tommy said that he liked it a lot.
Oliver said that he spoke French.
The engine was running.
Oliver and Laur said they're looking forward to being retired.
I'm not as rich as you think.
I am through with his long speech.
You can tell us yourself.
Be sure to be in time.
May I speak with you in private?
Unfortunately, I didn't have time to study for the exam, so I failed it.
Walk around the park five times.
Jack knows this city very well.
I'll be with Adam and Laur.
They say that Joe came to Brazil.
Do Alex and Mary need a place to stay?
Joe and Monica swear they won't cry.
They must be waiting for you.
I doubt that Charlie is still home.
I believe that's too much.
They failed to keep their promise.
I may be living in Boston next year.
He looked like he was unhappy.
Oscar is likely to still be better at doing that than Anna is.
We have to work hard to fix this problem.
We should stick to our plan.
Don't you think you're being a little hard on Oscar?
Adam claimed that he acted alone.
His mother got up much earlier than usual and started cooking as early as 8am.
Why shouldn't truth be stranger than fiction? Fiction, after all, has to make sense.
Tommy has been Valentina's next-door neighbor for three years.
Harry wasn't very thirsty.
Adam is going to tell Emma he loves her.
We need to start planning.
Make this shine.
This will happen to you too.
Tommy had another suggestion.
George said that he didn't believe Emma really planned on doing that.
If the patient is unconscious, the family can make the decision.
George found it confusing at first.
I only hope we can get this done on time.
I think that you're just wasting time.
Alice has put on a lot of weight since the last time I saw her.
He is five feet tall.
I used to speak French fairly well.
I helped the old lady cross the street.
Please do that today if you can.
Julia found Charlie where she expected him to be.
Do you love nature?
The cat likes mice; I donât like them.
Can I come in?
Call Oscar and tell him about it.
Can you remember the first time that you ever used a computer?
George was a taxi driver for about three years.
Oliver works for a large firm.
Adam doesn't need that.
Jami and I both left the room at the same time.
Jack and Olivia told me they'd be here by 2:30.
We heard the door close.
Aren't you going to finish your dinner?
Knowledge is the supreme goal.
Don't ignore her feelings.
Muhammad and Anna had another boy.
I don't remember your password.
George will probably go to Boston by car.
I'm not a soldier anymore.
Muhammad will probably be present.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
Just tell me to leave and I'll leave.
How did it end?
I'd like to do that soon.
Let's spend some time together.
We're going home right now.
It was so sweet of you to buy this for me.
Maybe you and I can go there together.
This rule can't be applied to that case.
He's quite good at his job.
If you work too long without a rest, it begins to tell on you.
Maybe Jacob and Lucy are busy.
I've promised William I'd do that.
I didn't know that that would happen.
Promise me that you won't sell your guitar to anyone but me.
None of you have any clue what William's going through.
Can you not see that Eva is pregnant?
I don't ever want you to do that again.
That would change everything.
William said he'd never seen anything like that before.
We were starting to worry you wouldn't make it in time.
Has James been getting into trouble?
I'm sorry, but I am opposed to this project.
Come on, let's take shelter.
Please take me along with you.
Can you believe that?
Tommy filled the pot with water.
James and Catherine don't believe John could do that without some help.
I thought you said 2:30.
I didn't drink that milk.
Who should get one?
What did Catherine say she was going to do tomorrow?
I am like them.
Good health is the most valuable of all things.
May I eat this cake?
I thought he was there.
I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Muhammad said that he thought you wouldn't win.
Don't play with his feelings!
Jack said Carmen was likely to still be interested.
She has a broad view of things.
All you need to do is just sit there and listen.
I have nothing to give George.
The kids are playing outside.
This is your key.
I'd like to drink another cup of coffee.
I need to buy an airplane ticket for Moscow.
We'll deal with him later.
Open the door for love.
"I loved you, Lucy." "Then why did you betray me?"
Oscar wasn't surprised by what Olivia did.
A man walks into a bar...
Today is the first day of 2019.
How late does this building stay open?
I just don't want anyone to be mad at me.
This is the medicine I was telling you about.
Charlie was surprised that Emma could do that.
I found out about a back-door registration technique from his secretary.
The cat ran away.
Mary lost control of her car.
Jami didn't seem to be as angry as Emma seemed to be.
I was sore for three weeks.
The people whom I meet are kind.
Do you think Jami was alone?
Tommy should have been on that train.
Jacob was nice to all of Margaret's friends.
Her parents were out of town.
Carmen recognized Oscar as soon as she saw him.
This is such an easy problem as any student can solve.
Jacob and Susie just closed their eyes and tried to ignore what was going on.
She is going.
He came from far away.
Would you sing us a song in French?
They bought a new computer yesterday.
Do you think you could do that without our help?
What did you want to see Charlie about?
Three of these are George's.
I don't think that Alex is as creative as Alice is.
Adam said that he should've done that by himself.
George is already pretty good at French.
He will come provided that he is well enough.
This is a no smoking zone.
I could barely speak French three years ago.
Lucy made up her mind to leave early.
James said that he didn't have to do that.
I didn't want anyone to know where I was.
I've been having trouble breathing.
Oscar is the one who drew this picture.
We rolled up the rug.
I offered to lend money to her.
Who burned the cake?
What were you doing in Australia last week?
I had a good night's sleep.
This furniture was in my apartment when I moved in.
Jack has a bad relationship with his mother.
The film began at 2.
Why did it have to be them?
Tommy and Catherine could get hurt if they did that.
Jacob and Mary said they weren't at home last night.
You've been letting me win, haven't you?
George doesn't seem to want to answer this question.
I almost left my umbrella on the bus.
How much longer do you think this will take?
There's no running water here.
Sorry but I looking for my sister. Is she here? I haven't seen her for a couple hours since we arrived.
I don't like people like Harry.
Everybody knows for sure that it was he who did it.
Is there any of them left?
I don't even have time for reading.
The average life of a dog is ten years.
I don't want to drive in this snow.
You need to turn left at the second light.
I hope you don't tell Alex that.
Peace is what we wish you.
Jami said that he thought that there was a good chance that it would snow.
The English are a great nation.
I neverÂ bothered toÂ do that.
Are you aware of the time, Love?
Tommy looked like he was ready.
The sun had already set when he got home.
I don't think that Jami knows exactly what he ought to do.
How can you be disappointed?
Muhammad and Carmen are crying.
I always read the sports page first.
We used to meet at that pleasant spot.
I don't even know them.
We just have to wait it out.
Muhammad said that Carmen didn't seem to be having much fun.
Joe has come home.
I can't go back to being just one of the guys.
Jacob didn't need that.
I sent you an e-mail.
I was surprised when William told me Catherine needed to do that.
I cannot get along with him.
Go inside that building. I will tell you what to do next.
Let's have dinner.
Muhammad and I are planning to get married.
Charlie looks somewhat angry.
I didn't think Muhammad was reasonable.
I don't swim, but I enjoy going to the beach.
I don't allow myself to have sweets.
I'm gonna miss him so much.
Is there anything I could help you with?
It will have been raining a week tomorrow.
He said some men had attacked him.
I guess Jacob just doesn't want to leave.
James doesn't actually live here.
Tommy never would've asked.
He makes his living by singing.
She told me she's safe.
His sister is a hard worker.
Muhammad will miss Catherine.
Better ask twice than lose your way once.
It's a good investment.
Alex seemed to like speaking French.
We couldn't help but think that he was dead.
I need to know who Jacob is.
I can't go yet.
Don't you dare cry!
Adam wasn't satisfied with the way I did that.
She's five years younger than he is.
Jacob is in debt.
I think Adam and Catherine don't live very near the school they go to.
Imagine how good you have it compared to other people.
He owns many valuable paintings.
The colony declared independence.
The news spread all over Japan.
Whenever he calls on me, he leaves something behind.
I could've left early.
I'm still not giving up.
I should tell Alex that he has to do that.
I was taking pictures.
Jack and Anna told me they weren't tired.
Charlie probably shouldn't have done that.
We still have one more problem to worry about.
I'm planning to read as many books as I can this year.
We're doing everything we can.
Just do the job.
I did some research.
I'm beginning to lose my patience.
William did that just a month ago.
Which gate is that?
I didn't know Jami was dating Emma.
Jack said I should go to Australia with you.
This rug is large enough to cover the whole floor.
Oliver doesn't want that.
Jami said that he wants to be a teacher.
You're so slow!
I don't think I know anybody in Boston.
They have their work.
He has absolutely no feel for it.
I'm sorry to be such a bother.
Waiter, may I have the bill please?
Harry pushed through the crowd.
Jami wants to become famous.
We have no extra money.
She knows that she messed up.
Alice may go home by herself.
I know it'll take a while.
Someone broke the lock and stole my bike.
I don't know everything there is to know about that.
I come to this city second time.
That's very, very sad.
They left their husbands.
What have you heard?
Oscar is going to show you the ropes.
I doubt if Jack would be willing to do that.
They said they felt threatened.
You need to do this.
Don't take it for granted that everybody has a car.
Oliver knew that Anna would be difficult to get along with.
I think that everyone has to make efforts to save nature.
He's not breathing!
Adam brought his son to work.
I'm going to have a date with my ex.
I find that he is intelligent because he is learning German.
Margaret said she did that the wrong way.
Olivia does not know what's waiting for her.
Jack said Alice was the only one who wanted to do that.
He's likely to be chosen.
I don't brush my teeth as many times a day as Oscar does.
Adam and Laur seem convinced that they have to do that.
He had a blue jacket on.
I have no reason to cook it.
Muhammad didn't expect Catherine to be there.
Are you sure we'll get there before the others?
It's not up to us.
Anna says she's already decided not to do that.
Jack wanted his land back.
He was always faithful to his wife.
I can't believe you told Harry.
Harry told us he could win.
You don't have to tell me that, fool.
I am ashamed of your conduct.
I want to leave here as much as you do.
I can help if you'd like.
It's going to be almost impossible to do that.
Tommy was sick in bed last Sunday.
I don't eat much fruit.
George blew out the candles on his birthday cake.
Tommy isn't so good at singing.
I spent a week in Florence last year. I'm sure you'll like it.
I have three sons. One is in New York, but the others are in London.
I thought that William had already finished his work.
What are you planning to do now?
I thought you had a meeting at 2:30.
How much more support do we need?
While in Europe, she visited Rome.
I wonder whether or not Jacob was at school today.
Jami said he'd never try to do that alone.
Everyone laughed except me.
How long has Oliver lived in Boston?
I'm really attached to my mother.
They want justice.
She looked like she was healthy.
The ground is very wet.
They were enjoying themselves.
I have never drawn anything in my life.
I can't really trust Jami.
He says he'd be happy to do that.
When will she get home?
You don't have to go in there.
How about some milk and cookies?
Muhammad has never been back there.
We had a rough voyage.
Don't get the wrong idea.
Slow down. You're driving too fast.
What exactly happened to you?
George is outside the door.
I know that he was busy.
She didn't laugh, did she?
Oscar has borrowed a lot of money from many people.
Be quiet and listen to me.
He got off his bicycle.
He is fast with his hand.
What Jacob told Margaret wasn't true.
Should we be worried?
Are we being charged with something?
They probably aren't in their offices.
I'm pretty sure Tommy and Carmen have never been to Boston.
I was surprised Oscar couldn't do that.
It was a nice surprise to return home and see a present sitting in the porch.
She was First Lady.
Jami told me that he wanted to teach French.
George said Monica will unlikely want to do that.
Not only the student but their teacher is looking forward to holiday.
Charlie needs to know that somebody cares.
I wasn't having much fun.
Why didn't somebody help Jack?
Don't you laugh at me.
Harry has a beautiful house.
Charlie told me he thought Alice was home.
I lost interest in money a long time ago.
Save up so that you can go to college.
Let me know what you decide.
William said that he wished he hadn't told Laur about what he did.
Muhammad is sure Eva knew she wasn't supposed to do that.
That's what I really want... I think.
You don't look like you're interested.
Tommy felt light-headed.
Jami travels.
I won't breathe a word.
Adam won't be bothering you anymore.
We're still trying to figure out how Charlie escaped.
Jacob was the only singer at the event who wrote the songs that he sang.
Harry wasn't the one who told me that he ought to do that.
Who's your roommate?
Margaret said she really wanted to be here, but she had to stay in Boston.
He burned a hole in his coat.
Where are you getting the money from?
Come down here!
Just shut your mouth if you value your job.
You should ask Joe to do that for you.
Harry and Margaret said they wanted to make sure that doesn't happen again.
He broke his ankle.
George cut the rope.
Ah! What nice weather!
Let's schedule a time.
I've been trying to find a way to reach Harry, but I can't.
I want you to let him live.
I understand Muhammad and Laur were together last night.
Nobody wants to be around her.
Oscar insisted on paying for dinner.
Adam and Olivia did what they promised they'd do.
I don't drink wine.
I could easily have done that.
Jacob is good at swimming, isn't he?
I spent a year in Australia.
James wasn't the only student who failed the test.
They began using their power to become rich.
This looks great.
Jami and Anna want to travel together.
Have you ever heard anything like that?
She never wrote him back.
You're the one who said I should to that.
Women age faster than men.
Charlie got here at 2:30 this afternoon.
Are you going to let him insult you like that?
Jack needs a bath.
Alex had to pay for everything himself.
Do you happen to know his name?
Adam said he walked home.
Let's do business.
I was there when George died.
She didn't have anything in her bag.
Jami doesn't want Mary to do that anymore.
Jacob may have to help Eva.
Alex ignored my warning.
Why didn't you just tell me?
Today is not so cold.
You need to put your foot down.
Give it a moment.
Her boyfriend did it for her.
We don't have enough money.
Today Iâm drinking hot chocolate.
I'm the only one who knows them.
George told me he hoped Valentina would be early.
You speak Japanese.
It's all said and down.
I know why Harry and Catherine are surprised.
Oscar thinks that Laur will be doing that very soon.
Muhammad said that he thought that I was funny.
I bet that dog is over there.
I was told to wait here.
If you had not eaten so much, you would not be so sleepy now.
After a long journey we finally arrived.
Do you think I can do that?
I don't feel like studying.
Can you guarantee our safety?
I needed a place to sit down and rest.
What was your score?
We really do see people as we think they are and not as they are.
I thought that I gave you the key yesterday.
I need to get her to a doctor.
You may want to tell Charlie that.
All of my friends are out of town.
Do you think animals have a soul?
I thought that you might like to know that William is planning to be here tomorrow.
There is no response from him.
Do you want it or not?
There will be no holiday for this summer.
The girl kissed her father on the cheek.
Joe was a friend.
Out you go!
James says he can do that by himself.
This party is awesome.
Don't play around on the way back from school.
Anna knows she doesn't have much choice.
Jami used to enjoy doing that.
Something seemed off.
Do you mind if I come along?
That's so gross.
Charlie is already beginning to talk.
It's not out yet.
I didn't know that you used to do that when you lived in Boston.
What really happened between James and Carmen?
I'll give this apple to anyone who wants it.
Can you accompany me there, please?
George got out of his car and opened the gate.
Tell him your name.
I'm sorry that I didn't call.
You swore that you wouldn't do that anymore.
I can't believe that you kissed Susie.
It's my fault, not yours.
Joe's shoes don't match his suit.
Oliver said that Julia is looking forward to seeing you.
She told me she'd come.
We're looking for the truth.
Alice will get dirty if she does that.
What do Jacob and Margaret like to do that you don't like to do?
This is a crime so well placed, in my opinion, that I cannot bring my mind to confess it.
She said that she's well.
Oscar works every day but Sunday.
I wasn't as poor as my neighbors.
I need to talk to Jami again.
He accepted our offer.
Is it that obvious that I have feelings for him?
Carmen did all she could to protect Jack.
Joe thinks that Valentina is beautiful.
Jack introduced his daughter to me.
Do you really need to print this?
I've only been here once before.
Is this some kind of joke?
I know Adam has to leave.
William and Lucy have something they need to do right now.
I don't think that I want to do that now.
Let's wait until it stops raining.
Oscar has been in Boston for three years now.
You never seem to have much to say.
It's not so.
Why don't you to do that right now?
There's life in the old boy yet!
I have no intention of staying here in Australia.
I live three doors down.
They tried to walk past Jacob.
They say that they didn't want to do that.
Nobody but Jami does that.
How long has Alex worked in Australia?
You sound confused.
What's George doing to help?
It would have been better if you'd stayed with Oscar.
George said that I seemed excited.
Tommy and Margaret fell in love and planned to marry after the war.
It'll be difficult to convince Charlie to help us clean the garage.
Oscar was very thoughtful.
I feel secure with him.
What will be planted in this field?
They swore they wouldn't leave early.
Don't Oscar and Emma swim?
Did you and Harry both like the movie?
James came last week.
Eva is washing the dishes, isn't she?
Is it good?
I wish Oliver and Anna had told me that they weren't going to the party.
Can't you live your own life?
Alex didn't know what to do.
What do you find so amusing?
Muhammad said that he wasn't going to answer any more questions.
Joe can't have been there yesterday.
Muhammad and I are planning on going to Boston next fall.
She quickly went up the stairs.
Tell me what to do and I will do it.
People living in this area are dying because of the lack of water.
James said he already did that.
I know Muhammad would've allowed you to do that.
You are my three best friends.
I think we need to encourage Muhammad to study a little harder.
William and Julia said that they'd be willing to do this.
The apples are not ready to pick yet.
Muhammad said that he didn't like Carmen very much.
I decided on my exercise program.
Alex and I are quicker than you are.
It was peaceful.
I spent a week in Boston.
I know little things mean a lot.
You have a funny laugh.
I worked late last night.
The parking lot is almost empty.
Have you finished packing your suitcase?
Every effort deserves a reward.
I know you don't ever want to see me again.
His death marks the end of a chapter in our history.
Do we represent you?
He told me that he's well.
If you want to divorce, you will have to pay the price.
He walked across the street.
He touched me on the cheek.
See you in a little while.
I wonder whether Charlie is planning to do that.
I've done everything I needed to do.
She signs the most important documents.
Come on in and sit down.
Jack and Lucy were arrested on October 20th.
My brother goes fishing every weekend.
Why are you so successful?
Oscar came here from Boston.
I don't think that George has to go to school next Monday.
There is a limit of two pieces of luggage for each passenger.
Margaret has done what Adam expected her to do.
Where did you find such an ugly hat?
Why does Jack like wearing hats so much?
That was the first time I tried doing that.
They cooked all their own meals.
It will be a wonderful day!
Most of Catherine's friends know that she's in the hospital.
I came for him.
Harry thought that Lucy would be too busy to help him.
I know that Adam already knows why Valentina doesn't have to do that.
I'm not joking.
Tommy said Margaret knew that John might not be required to do that anymore.
Jack asked Alice where she'd done that.
Are you sure this is the room we're supposed to be in?
I came to talk about Jacob.
How many weeks have Oliver and Susie been doing that?
I think Harry is from Boston.
I didn't know James was planning on doing that today.
James is just nervous.
I rarely ever laugh.
The computer is a machine that allows one to write as quickly as they think.
If you ever have any problem with Adam, I'll help you out.
That's something we're prepared for.
Nothing's changed yet.
William thought Lucy would know where John was.
Why did she stay at home yesterday?
Oscar did something very foolish.
I don't think that Tommy has as much experience as I do.
About how many times a day do you wash your hands?
You were good.
I love you more than I love her.
I thought that Adam would be in Boston on October 20th.
We'd better go check on it.
I brought a picture of you.
Maybe you'd better go get them.
I just want what's best for you.
Thank you, my child.
"The governor is dying," were the first words he said.
She said she had better things to do.
Monica claims she was born in 2013.
I know that Valentina is more beautiful than me.
More and more people drink orange juice.
Won't you go?
Does that matter?
I thought that you might be in Australia this week.
Let's go to Boston with Muhammad.
They're finishing their work.
I don't play video games.
You should've seen me run.
I don't think that I ever knew what Jack did for a living.
You should pay more attention to what I say.
Alex is sure that he'll succeed.
Muhammad should have told us about that earlier.
We've got to try and stop him.
He didn't see the stop sign and almost hit the child crossing the street.
The painting won't be sold.
Where can I get my suit pressed?
Could you please wait a minute?
I'm being patient.
I'll see you all later.
My dog bit her.
Adam isn't really my uncle.
Can you remember when Oliver joined our company?
Do you see that cute girl over there?
Tommy refused to kiss Catherine.
I didn't know you expected me to do that with James.
I don't know the answer to that.
Adam said more than Anna wanted him to.
It's about time we went to bed.
Jack moved to Australia last year.
The telephone is red.
I plan on buying a new umbrella.
Jack said Laur was likely to be drunk.
You should take her illness into consideration.
William spent time with Catherine.
George didn't know Mary was John's cousin.
As the poet says, a little learning is a dangerous thing.
They say they're good at chess.
I've already waited for three hours.
It's going to be hard to do that now.
I just got a text from James.
My leg hurts now.
Have you ever seen people actually go into that cave?
Oliver doesn't enjoy teaching French.
I suspect that Jack will come to Australia.
Maybe we could get together after work.
Alex and Lucy told John that they thought Alice wasn't finished doing that.
Do you know where I can get a taxi?
Catherine told James that she didn't think John was nervous.
Doesn't Jacob ever wear a shirt?
Everyone knew George didn't want to visit Boston.
What do you really think of her?
I asked Catherine to tell me what she wanted.
My house is very old.
When was the last time you sold a car?
How was the beach?
These windows are opened by him.
I can't put up with an insult like this.
Jacob hasn't hit a home run all season.
What do you love about the environment?
My French class is at 2:30.
I'm pretty sure that Oliver is now in Australia.
Jacob couldn't have done that without your help.
Jack does that differently than me.
She did what she was supposed to do.
I think you had better call on him.
William ought to be allowed to go to Eva's party.
Harry wondered why Catherine was so nervous.
We talk about that a lot.
Oliver is aware of the risks involved.
We organized a water fight in school.
Even though they were poor, they were happy.
William said that he thought we should do that by ourselves.
Thanks, George. I had fun today.
We only want to help you.
Muhammad is probably not going to come tomorrow.
Even if I knew where Oscar was, I wouldn't tell you.
You shouldn't forget to sleep.
We can take the subway there.
That's absolutely amazing.
After talking to Muhammad for a few minutes, it became obvious that his French wasn't very good, so Mary switched to English.
I had a terrible experience.
Harry promised to talk to Laur about that.
Joe wanted to get someone to do that for him.
People are beginning to notice Charlie.
We were all at school together.
Everybody's so busy.
I wish I could talk about it.
Jack isn't sure what to believe.
I would like this meeting to last less than ten minutes.
Oliver and Julia are screaming.
This isn't possible without Muhammad's help.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Because the president is a human being, making mistakes is possible.
Laur is quite busy now, isn't she?
I know that Oliver has finished doing that.
I didn't know that you were still a high school student.
Life isn't all fun and games.
Everyone survived.
They completed the picture hand in hand.
Where were you when Muhammad needed help?
Alex and Carmen said they didn't cry.
We both forgot about the meeting.
You're shorter than I am, aren't you?
You still haven't met your girlfriends parents?
People are so funny.
We forgot you don't like pizza.
I thought that they'd find someone else.
Eva said she's glad James didn't get hurt.
Charlie said that Monica knew that he wanted to do that by himself.
No, you don't have my approval.
Where can I get some?
William and Julia both have quite a few friends.
Everyone is on vacation.
Is there some way I can assist you?
I just had breakfast with her.
I'm sure glad to see you.
This is not a video game. This is real life.
We're getting married in Australia.
I'm really sorry that I told you that.
They caught up with him at the entrance.
We're about to eat.
William and Alice told me they didn't like doing that.
Too sweet.
Was the message delivered?
Jacob can't believe Olivia is serious.
It'll just take a second.
Positive feelings grant good health.
Health is the first condition of happiness.
Is there anyone here who hasn't been to Boston?
Oliver will get you in trouble.
I don't really watch TV.
I hope Adam and Lucy aren't stubborn about that.
She's hoping you'll help her.
I tell it like it is.
Laur told me she thought it would be fun to do that.
"Have you finished it?" "On the contrary, I'm just starting."
Joe is usually quite organized.
Eat a lot!
We will win the battle.
I do not know whether to accept or to refuse.
Adam let me know he wanted to do that.
George was not in the mood to laugh.
Tommy's finished.
They think that they're related to me.
William said he was glad that you did that for Olivia.
I'm really glad you came over.
Laur's husband is just as funny as she is.
Few passengers survived the accident.
Friends are more important than relatives.
Mary is having a bad dream.
How did it go?
What's it to you?
I didn't believe Oliver.
Susie read everything she could find.
Muhammad said he'd be afraid to do that alone.
We're embarrassing ourselves.
I need to pay the rent.
You sound like an old woman.
We've got two cats - one is white, and the other's black.
There's not much else to say.
This spider is pretty aggressive.
I'm really enjoying this book.
That's the only way to describe it.
None of us think Joe will help us.
I want to buy a more expensive watch.
I hope they all have fun.
I don't want to run into him.
Oscar was stabbed multiple times.
They told me that they love me.
I never saw that coming.
I'm still waiting for William to do that.
Alex finally realized that Catherine was right.
I think that James was the one who told me that.
Do you want your whiskey straight or should I mix it with water?
They bought themselves sports cars.
Love me little, love me long.
There were three people waiting before me.
I should have done that the way Jack told me to do it.
That tie is too expensive.
I'll spend next winter in Australia.
He filled up the hole in the wall.
Tommy stood at the sink, washing his hands.
I didn't know Jack knew why Mary did that on Monday.
Everybody at school knows Jami can't swim.
What happened to your car?
I'm not sure that anyone would be willing to help me.
Joe says he doesn't think Alice would let you do that.
Do you think I should stop Oscar?
Harry's mother told him that he should eat more vegetables.
It was super embarrassing.
I'm trying to help a friend.
Monica knew that what she was doing was wrong.
I don't think William and Olivia know that they aren't supposed to be doing that.
Joe is going to be sleeping by the time we get there.
That's shit!
I don't like speaking in French and Muhammad and Alice don't either.
What time did you get to bed last night?
Joe has helped us in the past.
Lucy didn't tell Alex what she wanted to eat.
Were they shopping?
Anna is the only woman that I've ever been in love with.
Alex and Carmen locked themselves in their rooms.
I have three older brothers.
It wasn't that hard, was it?
James attempted to escape.
I think Jacob is much younger than Emma.
Say what you want, it won't change his mind.
Oscar said he figured Margaret could win.
Tommy wanted to see Susie before she left.
They hate their parents.
I need to find her now!
What's your favorite alcoholic drink?
Joe has started looking for a job.
I know that I can trust Charlie.
They said they need to do that.
We carry out some research into the causes of brain damage.
I'll tell Tommy and Mary you're looking for them.
The children were eager for their father's news.
We've solved the problem.
How soon can you get to my house?
The countryside is pretty.
I'm not sure it's a good idea for you to do that.
I've always done that that way.
George says he doesn't think Julia really did that.
How much time did we lose?
She can't hold a tune.
I suspect Alex and Susie don't often do that.
Jack and Catherine had a hard time making themselves understood in French.
See if you can persuade William to come.
Margaret said that she wants me to help her tomorrow afternoon.
She's always so fast!
Adam is the one who takes out the garbage.
You shouldn't make any noise when you eat soup.
I've already done everything you've told me to do.
Lucy was sitting at the counter by herself.
We want it back.
Everyone should go.
It's their choice.
Maybe Charlie and Mary don't know exactly what they should do.
I need to work on that.
Joe grabbed Olivia by the hand.
I was mean to William.
George said that he thought he might be required to do that.
Tommy has already joined the team.
Physics is not easy to learn.
Emma is out walking her dog.
Neither Jack nor Valentina has suggested a solution.
I'll tell George the truth when the time comes.
I was unlucky.
Jack is worried about Anna's safety.
I don't feed my dog in the morning.
Alex said he didn't want Lucy to do that.
Tommy has been in there for hours.
Which train are you catching?
In some ways education is like a disease: you have to get over it.
I don't really enjoy watching baseball on TV.
Is it a big deal?
You don't like the way I do that, do you?
Jami sang better than usual tonight.
Would you happen to know what this is?
Does this remind you of anybody?
You look great.
Do you think that Jami still has many friends left in Australia?
I'm pretty sure banks will be closed tomorrow.
Oscar isn't inside.
Laur said she didn't know what she was supposed to do.
George said that he'd finish doing that by himself.
He will like it.
I used to be wealthy.
Do you want help with that?
Charlie is expected to do that later today.
Dan didn't even help Linda.
I'm so happy to see you.
What did Jack and Catherine tell you they had to do?
I'm the only person here who can speak French.
I don't often tell jokes.
Nancy has been on good terms with my sister for more than five years.
I hear Joe and Emma have both quit school.
Oliver's father doesn't approve of him having long hair and a beard.
We have more than a hundred books at home.
They found the track of a bear in the snow.
It wasn't at all what Harry had expected.
I wonder whether or not Tommy will go to Boston.
The entrance is on the other side of the building.
I want to know when you'll be arriving.
Both Adam and Carmen are wearing hats.
I hate myself.
I have no free time.
I'm on my way back home.
Jacob and Eva told me that they were innocent.
Joe will go to Boston the month after next.
Jami said that he wished that he hadn't tried doing that.
You must talk to Oscar in person.
We are living in fear, we are suffering, we are not enjoying the sun and flowers, we are not enjoying our childhood.
We couldn't stop it.
We're very curious.
So he put them in prison three days.
The boy filled his bag with clothes.
Jack threatened Emma.
Did you think I was being too noisy?
After the lightning, came the thunder.
I met someone yesterday who knows you.
To do him justice, he is a good-natured man.
Sorry, the line is busy now.
Why's the door locked?
It may not be necessary for us to go to that meeting.
Emma is going as fast as she can.
I didn't say I wasn't going.
I'm not sure it's a good idea.
They walked their dogs in the park.
There is a strange man at the door.
I don't feel like doing anything when it's this hot.
He need not have come to the party last night.
Everyone except Joe left.
Muhammad pointed at something on the ground.
Please let me carry your bag.
May happiness knock early at your door, April.
It sounds like Jami is in trouble.
Charlie is still angry, isn't he?
Alex says he can't put up with the heat any longer.
Why do you follow me?
Why did she call?
I didn't think James would cry.
How did you spend your free time?
I've got a great idea for a Christmas present.
I read the report carefully.
Who hurt you?
He drank himself to death.
She sent you here, didn't she?
Oliver acts like he's exhausted.
Can I see that credit card?
He's way more experienced than I am.
Emma eats less than her sister does.
Why should that surprise you?
George isn't even from Boston.
James became very bored.
It was Alex who started the fight.
I'll never be forgiven.
Lucy is wearing a blue dress.
Olivia thought she was being cute.
Oliver says Boston is his favorite city.
Oliver, can I speak to you alone, please?
Adam doesn't know any other way to do that.
Mary says she's too busy to do that.
This is a basketball ball.
Aren't you over 18?
I forgot to tell you that Alex and Monica are coming over for dinner tonight.
I'm sure Jack will contact everybody.
You'd think they'd tell me what they want.
James doesn't look very confident.
Just keep training hard.
Stir the paint with a stick.
William paid for lunch.
I'm the teacher.
I didn't know if I could do it or not.
They said they knew how to win.
William was desperate to defend his reputation.
William was gone by the time we got there, but Monica wasn't.
I know that Harry loves basketball.
We have to clear the snow off the roof.
I am not worried about it.
I really need to sleep.
He showed me the camera which he had bought the day before.
Jami discovered Eva was stealing from the cash register.
Oliver is headed back to Australia.
You have been sitting here all this time and I didn't even notice you.
We changed everything.
They know that they were wrong.
You seemed convinced that Oliver wanted to do that.
Alex is probably going to win the race.
I said sit down.
Oliver said that he thought Catherine was suspicious.
I just didn't want you in here.
Harry said he's always done that.
Neither Adam nor Mary has experience doing that.
I'm sorry, but it's time.
Eva said that she wasn't in pain.
Is that French?
I realize that I'm not very likely to be able to do that.
It would be fantastic if we could sing together.
The student center is a good place to strike up conversations.
Alex won't have time to do anything else today.
Jacob didn't deserve the punishment that he received.
Isn't this against the rules?
We are going by train.
I agree completely with you on this point.
James tried on the hat, but it didn't fit.
You have a job to do.
Jacob invited Laur to his place to watch a movie.
Why isn't Muhammad planning on doing that?
She came with her parents.
The story ended suddenly.
I'm just trying to survive.
Oscar told me that he found something in the garden that I might be interested in.
I told William, but he didn't believe me.
She blew on her hands to warm them.
You should have just told me earlier.
Jacob stood over Valentina with a knife.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
How long are you staying in Japan?
Someone sent us a gift.
Generally speaking, men can run faster than women can.
There was a tall tree in front of my house.
George admitted that he didn't like Valentina very much.
Guess how tall I am.
We did it by ourselves.
I told Jami that it was important to be there by 2:30.
Oliver spent a week in Australia last winter.
Tommy said that Alice knew John might not have to do that.
It is very important to think for yourself and to study.
Don't open the box yet.
The change of air worked wonders for her.
What are you guys looking at?
Experience is important.
I'm afraid to be alone at night.
I can't leave the house looking like this.
Why does Joe treat Lucy that way?
It's not death that I fear, but dying.
I know Jack is a lot older than I am.
James seemed determined.
Don't think about that anymore.
You are required to not smoke.
I've decided to do that a different way.
Back 'er up!
I'm glad you're over your cold.
My new course starts today.
The nest fell on the ground.
I thought you said you're tired of waiting for Jami to do that.
I have many things to do now.
If your parents like your job, then it's shit.
Adam shouldn't have waited until today to do that.
He always said he could do that.
William is a little worried about what might happen if he does that.
My younger sister is very good at singing.
I looked down at the ground.
That's what I've been doing.
She's so soft everywhere.
Jacob brought Olivia a cup of coffee.
We're looking for someone who speaks French.
Valentina didn't want to admit that she was scared.
Adam believes whatever I say.
That's something you'll regret.
My aim is to be a doctor.
We caught you.
Why wasn't George here today?
I didn't get much sleep last night.
My house faces to the south.
Jacob enjoyed reading Olivia's letters.
I thought that you said you've seen people doing that.
Oscar didn't tell Margaret about the robbery.
The current is very strong.
He cannot sing well.
Oscar told us a very interesting story.
He grabbed me by the collar.
I want to hear what Joe and Olivia have to say.
Oscar wanted to know what caused the accident.
Here there are a few stuck keys.
She can express her feelings when she feels happy or sad.
Are you offering to help?
How many people have been in today?
I haven't really made up my mind yet.
What would you have done in my place?
James couldn't find a job in Boston, so he came back home.
Joe suggested that we wait here.
That isn't very good.
We are supposed to have a meeting this day week.
I said turn right.
Emma looked like she was dizzy.
I'll try to be more like her.
Harry doesn't know I wish that he'd leave.
He told me he was a liar, but I don't believe him.
You're fooling yourself.
Oliver and Margaret probably couldn't do that by themselves.
They will accept your proposal.
She said she was still afraid.
Must I reserve a ticket a long time in advance?
I wish I were somebody important.
Where is this road?
I thought that you said that I could count on you.
I heard that both Charlie and Anna have been fired.
Don't you know anything about that?
Is it cold today? â No, it isn't.
I need to pay.
I didn't tell Adam I had been married before.
Who did that with Oliver?
Jack and Alice will pay me back what they owe me on Monday.
Where did he get his hat?
I was going home.
He said that he was very drunk.
Muhammad wanted to find out the cause of the accident.
Did you order the bombing?
I thought that we could do that.
Your link isn't working.
The whale is the largest animal on the earth.
I could've helped you out.
Meanwhile I can make myself understood.
I made soup in a big pot.
We're sure of that.
You do hope Adam will do that, don't you?
Jack has no object in life.
Alex did everything he possibly could to help Valentina.
Charlie and Monica told John they didn't plan to go.
Your help will save us a lot of work.
Why can't Joe go to Boston with you?
Say hello.
This is a bad deal.
Why doesn't Oscar like to eat fish?
I thought she was my friend.
Jacob may do that with Valentina.
I know that Alex isn't a very successful businessman.
I was quite hungry.
Be quiet for a second.
I think Oliver is healthy.
George told me that he was depressed.
We're talking about our friends.
The differences were minor, so I ignored them.
I thought you missed your flight.
He tried to convince them of his innocence in vain.
I sometimes make mistakes.
We're going to crash.
William and Anna said that they weren't tired.
Alex didn't have the courage to say no.
Can I tell you what bugs me?
We could ask them not to go.
Joe is probably going to stop crying soon.
There were two cakes.
Neither Adam nor Emma has a younger brother.
No one has to know.
George has no idea where Mary is planning on doing that.
She has her heart in music.
I don't think anyone could've done better than you did.
Oliver needs to get back here soon.
I don't believe we've ever met.
Following traffic rules is important.
I'll go tell them.
It was very hot this afternoon.
You ought not to say such a thing.
Only ever reading books like you do is bad for your health.
Jack's happiness means more to me than anything else in the world.
I have to ask him to help us.
Muhammad is probably planning to stay in Australia until October.
Joe and Julia may go fishing by themselves.
I sure hope I don't catch what's going around.
We have our lives to live.
I know William wasn't going to do that.
Have some coffee. I think it's really nice.
I sometimes have pain in my stomach.
I've always been poor.
She wouldn't let anybody help her.
Jane is very likely to come.
George walked to the window.
Alex could be armed.
I still haven't told Tommy why I want to do that.
I thought Joe would be awake when I got home.
There is no shame in saying 'I don't know'.
I want her to call every day.
Muhammad is too old to play games.
Jacob is able to do that with his eyes closed.
I've told you what you must do.
Muhammad said he wouldn't attend the meeting.
You're a quick study.
Why don't you believe me when I say I'm busy?
Love is complicated.
George did what we told him to do.
I'd do it myself, but I'm busy.
He and I are very happy about this message.
You're in love with Joe, aren't you?
George had a decision to make.
How did you get out of helping your father clean out the garage?
We should try to get Oliver to help us.
She's barely learning.
I can always go back to school.
We don't have to get there on time.
Open this present first.
I wonder whether Oscar will call me or not.
He gave me all the money he was carrying with him.
Muhammad says you may not need to do that.
I must make sure of the fact before I blame her.
Muhammad asked me how old I was.
Tommy was the only one who was doing that.
I was with someone.
How do you know it's not real?
If you're looking for Oliver, he isn't here.
He told me that I looked pale and asked me what the matter was.
Let me pass by!
I learned French, before going to Europe.
Why didn't you tell me I had to do that?
I like English and music.
The Red Cross is a non-profit organization.
I'm quite tired.
I know Adam knew that we should've done that by ourselves.
William said that he knew Laur needed to do that.
Would you like me to turn the TV off?
William turned Monica down.
This will never happen again, I swear to you.
She hit the nail on the head.
I'm glad we made some progress.
Don't point at others.
I was not lonely.
What were you doing this time yesterday?
We are hoping for good weather during the sports festival.
I keep meaning to organize my desk.
Alex is smart enough to not do that.
He claims to be a friend, but it not such.
I didn't know that I could do that.
I had no idea there'd be this many people here.
Has anyone spoken to her?
Did you get your receipt?
Harry didn't need to stay, but he did.
They haven't said what they plan to do.
Seeing you always makes me think about my father.
I'm sorry, but could you buy me some bread?
I'll explain to you how to use it when I come back.
William must be mad.
Joe is working with Anna.
Eva's dog is still waiting for her just outside the front door.
I need this job.
He'd do that if you asked him to.
Could you tell me the way to Tokyo Tower?
Mr. Gray was the first man that arrived.
Oliver and Emma sat next to each other at the table in the conference room.
Jami did that as soon as he was able to.
Jami doesn't like punk rock.
Are you scared to tell Oliver?
Boston was a great place to grow up.
He put his toys into the toy box.
It is necessary that you take a good rest.
These apples look very fresh.
I sure hope Jack comes to Boston in October.
You're lost, aren't you?
I'll just get my coat.
Let me introduce you to him.
I want to make a phone call.
I don't think George knows whether Mary likes dogs or not.
Alex's suitcase is too heavy for him to carry.
Sue picked up a pencil off the floor.
I had a boyfriend named Jack.
There's a hero, if you look inside your heart.
How dare you speak to me in this way!
I thought that you said you were glad you didn't do that.
We've ordered Chinese food.
Oliver doesn't think Julia did that.
Don't shout like that, he's not deaf.
Neither shall there remain any thing of it until morning. If there be any thing left, you shall burn it with fire.
I knew Harry and Susie weren't good at sports.
Oscar and Margaret said they knew John might need to do that today.
I don't think that my ex-girlfriend and I'd ever start dating again.
Muhammad wanted an apology.
What are you so afraid of?
Charlie is eager to meet Emma again.
Tommy is likely eating right now.
The boy stood on end.
Joe took off on his bike.
He did it in good faith.
Adam will try to convince Monica to help him.
I doubt very seriously Jack will stop doing that.
William should have arrived by now.
I can't believe you could say something like that.
I've lived in Boston for a few years.
Do you remember what happened on this day last year?
I have to be there by 7:00.
The mother lay beside her baby on the bed.
I know I'm not perfect.
I promise that I won't tell anybody why we're here.
Jami and Olivia don't know how much time they'll have to do that.
Muhammad and Mary would do that if you asked them to.
Jami often goes for walks with Olivia.
Joe and I don't do that by ourselves very often.
Harry has been putting on weight recently.
Linda was Dan's girlfriend at that time.
Have you ever forgotten how old you are?
The roaring lion terrified the boy.
Joe said that he knew he might not need to do that by himself.
Alex said that he was going to ask Valentina to leave.
George scored the first goal.
I want something more.
I'll stay home today.
My son, Harry, and his fiancÃ©e, Lucy, got married today.
When was the last time you taught driving?
Jacob still uses dial-up Internet.
God, give us peace!
I've seen enough.
Where's he wandering about?
I didn't know that James and Laur were sick.
Odds are that won't happen.
Jack is terribly jealous.
George is going to find Alice.
Doing that probably won't be safe.
I didn't do that as quickly as I should have.
Carmen got first prize, didn't she?
I've been worried sick about you. Why didn't you call?
Believe in yourselves.
It was very confusing.
I don't like to ride the train during rush hour.
It's great to be with you.
The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star.
Did you feel the earthquake last night?
You're no friend of mine.
Jacob and Laur say that they aren't going to do that.
I've decided to try doing that myself.
I have lived here since I was a boy.
Harry says that he saw Catherine doing that.
Alice told Oliver that she didn't think she'd be able to do that again.
Why is Australia a popular destination for tourists?
We just have to learn to live with it.
I thought Muhammad would be better at doing that.
Mike is one of our brains.
Jack is broke again.
Monica married for money.
Jacob and Eva said that they wouldn't cry.
I went to the airport by taxi.
I'm the only other person who could've done that.
There are other ways to do this.
She is responsible for it.
Please take me to the hospital.
His voice is that of a god.
Why does Tommy need to go to Australia?
I thought that Harry didn't work today.
Charlie has been seeing somebody else.
I'm sure he'll be as good as his word.
I used to be a strong man.
"What did you talk about?" "Nothing."
England was once torn by civil war.
Where does Jacob want to go?
I told Tommy that I couldn't do that.
William told me he wasn't in pain.
My dad doesn't know, but mom does.
I found him a job.
It is bold of him to refuse our offer.
Joe asked Emma to help me.
William shut his computer down.
The job's almost done.
Muhammad can speak French pretty well.
How did Oliver manage to lose so much weight so quickly?
Charlie and Eva wanted to get married and have kids as soon as possible.
Did you need something?
Were you happy with the results?
Adam is never here in the morning, is he?
Adam didn't know what to do with it.
We love it here.
Do what I tell you.
It's too simple.
I didn't expect to meet you.
Jack said that he thought he might be allowed to do that.
Let's keep this simple.
You have to tell George not to do that.
I didn't want to testify against Jami.
William didn't want any of his friends to know he was a drug dealer.
Why can't we go to school like everybody else?
This letter is for you.
He said that he knew how to win.
When do the Christmas holidays begin?
How are your grades?
That's the reason I didn't do that.
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.
He is shit out of luck.
I made no comment.
Try harder to find the answer; there must be one.
Men with guns were waiting for them.
Jack tried to read Carmen's name tag.
Joe was my boyfriend at that time.
I didn't know why Adam didn't need to do that until he told me.
He swore he was innocent.
Unfortunately Alex isn't healthy.
Adam finally managed to persuade Julia to help him.
It is not always easy to make a good joke.
Can I reserve a seat to Hawaii for Christmas?
Are you willing to risk that?
I know that Joe knew I'd never done that before.
Tommy is likely to be alone, isn't he?
I saw you looking at her.
Oscar has apparently committed suicide.
She is very talented.
Harry sat next to Mary on the floor.
It shouldn't be this quiet.
Alex said that he didn't think that Eva really needed to do that.
Of course, I didn't tell Oscar.
How many days do you want to stay in Boston?
I'll stay at home.
You made the same mistake again.
I know William knew that I had to do that.
James didn't want to explain it to me.
Jacob said Lucy is probably still in Australia.
You can't tell Jacob what happened.
Joe and Alice say that they'll leave on Monday.
Harry told me that he was lost.
My mom thinks I'm smart.
It's William's brother's birthday today?
From here on out things are going to change, for the worse.
I appreciate your interest.
He hasn't been married long.
I found the bed very comfortable.
You look amazing.
James and Olivia told everyone that they were done.
I am learning Turkish.
That's not like you.
You aren't telling me the whole truth, are you?
Do Jack and Lucy have to do that, too?
Oscar doesn't think it was Carmen's fault.
Don't you like that?
I know that Oliver is a better pilot than Eva is.
He gave in.
I don't know if that's true.
Look, I don't want to lose my job.
We have to split.
I think that Joe won't be home on October 20th.
I wonder if Jami and Margaret are done.
How much does the average car weigh?
Why don't you buy a new car?
She told me she told you.
Specialist workers are in demand.
I've got nothing.
Do you hate horror movies?
She said that she knew who did that.
Oscar doesn't like to eat where people are smoking.
I'll be in Australia by this time tomorrow.
Is it hard for you to do this?
I saw Jami sitting on the porch.
Please take off your shoes.
Tommy closed his umbrella and put it in the umbrella rack near the door.
Dan didn't fulfill his duty.
I wouldn't trust Tommy if I were you.
He is always complaining of ill treatment.
It takes me hours to feel like I'm awake.
He told me he was thirty.
Jami couldn't remember the punch line of the joke he wanted to tell.
How much does that lamp cost?
It appears that she has a secret.
I'm the first musician in my family.
I'm not sure that I really understand this.
It was a very hard training.
This is not an easy question.
You didn't tell them what he wrote in that article.
Oscar wouldn't have done that if Alice hadn't been there.
Doesn't Oscar ever get tired?
Jami said that he walked home.
Oliver is happy now.
I have a weak stomach.
It was a private matter.
I think it might be dangerous for Harry and Olivia to do that by themselves.
I never see him but I am happy.
I don't name names.
Your sentence structure and word choice make it very clear indeed that you have a high command of the German language.
Charlie is very likely to succeed.
I was able to see the doctor.
I told you the result as soon as it was made public.
Olivia is too young to retire, isn't she?
I thought you weren't supposed to do that.
I'm not able to do that because I don't have enough money.
I chose to look the other way.
I don't think I'd ever want to live in Australia.
I couldn't live without you.
This night was inevitable.
At the end of the day, it's just food.
Would you help me out?
Keep it to five words.
He hopes that he'll be able to win.
I can't be bothered to do my homework.
Do you really want to live in Boston?
I thought I told you not to come here.
Why are you always defending Jami?
Tokyo is by far the largest city in Japan.
Did you just insult me?
You need to make a real change.
They said that they understood.
Can I pay you tomorrow instead of today?
Let me know the results later.
Don't depend on other people too much.
I think that Joe is a good lawyer.
She joined her school's drama club.
Stop the car immediately.
His car broke down on the way to work.
Well, shall we call it a day?
It's been a long time since I've talked to Charlie.
Olivia said she thought I was the only one who knew how to do that.
You shouldn't do that with just anybody, you know.
"How did it go?" "It went well."
My cat is running around the room.
He gave me a piece of advice.
Are you sure you're up to this, George?
Oscar usually drinks a lot more than Lucy does.
Joe is still breathing.
I'm disappointed in you, Joe.
Olivia doesn't know I don't like her.
Jami was very fat when he was in junior high school.
George and Emma said they didn't want me to tell John what had happened.
How did Oscar know Olivia would win?
I don't think that Harry can convince Alice to stay.
I think we could do that.
Joe says he's never owned a car.
The language I'm learning now is not the same language he's learning.
There is an apartment house near my house.
I think Jacob could do that if he really needed to.
No one has ever asked me that question before.
How are you going to get to Australia?
Can we have a minute alone?
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that with us.
I don't think it's up to you to decide.
Oliver didn't answer at first.
I've already spoken to her.
Make sure Charlie gets his homework done.
I guess we wouldn't have been able to carry out the plan if it weren't for your help.
Oliver didn't believe my story.
No one knew that James was in Boston.
I need that medicine.
I imagine Joe will be here soon.
Jack looks interested.
They started fighting.
That took place in Boston three weeks ago.
The rich are not always happy.
I don't blame William.
She enjoyed herself at the party yesterday.
It's just a cut.
He tried in vain to lift up the stone.
Oscar and Margaret say that they want something to eat.
"Where is your father?" "I don't have one."
Jack is going to talk about that at today's meeting.
Tommy said that he wanted to go swimming with us.
You've won my heart.
They ran naked in the park.
I'm going to wash my car.
I didn't lose that much.
Julia said she wouldn't dream of allowing Jacob to do that.
Where's the proof?
Harry didn't have any problems with Emma.
Susie said she thought Jami probably wouldn't do that.
I have never been to England.
They sat up talking late at night.
I really had to run for it to catch the train.
Keep your thoughts to yourselves.
What have you told her?
Try on another one.
She drank a cup of milk.
Jami went to Boston three days ago.
Oscar was the only one who wasn't asleep.
Harry is confused, isn't he?
James had nothing to say, so he left.
When it comes to dancing I have two left feet.
I don't drink beer, only spirits.
Will world peace ever be a reality?
Bow down!
This is good news.
I just want to hug you.
I don't think that it'll be easy for me do that.
Adam said that he'd expected Susie to do that yesterday.
You'll just be losing ground.
I don't think that we'll do that here.
Oscar didn't plan on doing that.
I know that George is the one who's supposed to tell Laur she won't be allowed to do that.
Oscar was one of them.
Jami stopped taking care of his family.
When do you think Jacob is going to want us to do that?
He was seen to enter the building.
He left Japan at the end of the year.
I know that you put your best effort into it.
James is packing his things into boxes.
She put her room in order before her guests arrived.
"Whose cows are these?" "They are my grandmother's."
Of course, this is illegal.
How late did Jack work yesterday?
The eyes are the window into the soul.
I didn't know William knew how long it was going to take to do that.
I had completely forgotten to do that.
It's quiet enough to hear a pin drop.
I understand nobody wants to help us.
We won't have time to do anything else today.
Don't expect anybody to help you.
I think that Alex is going to Australia next month.
Tommy is a very clever student.
Muhammad was very late, wasn't he?
It's not always about the money, is it, Oliver?
Are you guys free this afternoon?
Muhammad can't take it any longer.
Tell us a little bit about yourselves.
I have always been very passionate about literature.
We're doing fairly well.
What was the name of the last song you sang last night?
If you'd stuck around, you would have had a lot of fun.
Harry still hasn't forgiven me.
You aren't afraid of dying, are you?
I knew your mother well.
Why don't you ask Alex to help you wash the car?
I'd advise you to stick to your principles rather than give in so quickly to her demands.
The teacher wore a harsh expression on his face.
I have a feeling you're going to like Australia.
Would you step aside?
We all believe in something.
What? You can't drive yet?
William offered to give me money.
Money is the last thing on his mind.
James doesn't have time to eat right now.
I need you to help me today.
I was lucky that I was able to do that.
I'm sure that's what William needs.
I'm nice to Oliver.
I told Muhammad he was a coward.
Though it's not the same as holding a copy in your hand, it can be useful to see what's out there.
The elephant was shot.
Joe, what do you want for supper?
I can't believe you just did that.
George didn't get upset.
What is he drinking?
Tommy said he doesn't enjoy doing that as much as he used to.
George doesn't have much of a choice.
George seemed to be well.
She likes to show off.
Charlie may not pass the test.
I am thankful for friends who keep me active and social.
There was nothing left to do.
Look, I'm a little busy.
Is there any chance that Oscar can win?
We've been working hard on this.
I didn't think Oscar was lonely.
I know that Jacob doesn't know I need to do that.
Alex says that's not enough.
Normally, I wouldn't have been so busy.
He lives in a village.
Jacob asked me to meet Monica at the station.
Do you know anyone who would be able to help me?
I don't think that Jami wanted Margaret to do that by herself.
He asked the teacher about something.
It is a table.
She could've kicked herself.
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
She is poor, but she is happy.
James is very late, isn't he?
Charlie stuck out like a sore thumb.
Have you bought all your Christmas gifts?
Charlie and Laur said they didn't want to talk to me.
Joe seemed to be curious.
It looks like Laur got what she wanted.
Jami seemed to be in good health.
I don't know when William got to Australia.
You can use my car as long as you drive it carefully.
I know that William knows I had to do that.
James won't name names.
Both Jami and I enjoy watching horror movies.
Is it already so late?
He knows that he hears something.
George had a good reason not to go.
I was a reporter.
It's normal in Germany.
She's just a liar.
Everyone here except me has done that.
I suspect that Adam and Laur aren't able to do that very well.
Oliver is most likely doing that now.
Charlie seemed surprised when Monica said that she didn't know John.
She said she'll laugh.
The dress costs fifteen euros.
I don't want to live in a country that doesn't want to defend my rights.
Are you Jami Jackson by any chance?
I'm not used to having so much free time.
Charlie is trying to do what's right.
Someday your dream will come true.
Tommy said Olivia looked like she was busy.
I think you should tell Charlie that you won't be here tomorrow.
I'm sure she has other skills.
That doesn't sound very exciting.
"When should we tell Muhammad this?" "Now is the best time."
I don't think Oliver will be cold.
Joe is seriously thinking about doing that.
Do you think we can trust Oliver?
She pulled him out of the mud.
I don't remember how this movie ends.
I knew who he probably was.
I want to know why you thought that I was supposed to do that.
It was kind of a surprise.
Don't listen to that man.
Jacob is a professional football player.
I don't want to risk our plan just because you are trigger-happy!
I don't think George and Carmen are listening to me.
The air felt a little cold.
I didn't know that I'd be late.
He said he didn't want to leave.
I'll pay for this.
Is it OK if I stay here?
Julia said that she didn't feel cold.
Adam wanted to get married to Valentina.
William and Emma didn't seem to care that nobody seemed to like them.
I'm not saying that it's not possible.
I didn't want Tommy to know what had happened.
Alice told me she'd do it tomorrow.
Oscar and I used to work for Valentina.
What a fine moon we have tonight!
I'm worried about what'll happen if Adam comes.
Adam got offended.
Might there be life after death?
Thank you for always sticking up for me when necessary.
I never meant to hurt them.
Neither Adam nor Olivia has agreed to work for us.
They said that they knew that I would come.
Tommy laughed so loud that Monica could hear him from the kitchen.
Why did Harry and Olivia kill themselves?
Are you suggesting that we call Jack?
Olivia says she isn't planning on doing that anymore.
This is a complex problem.
Harry and Mary said they were really worried.
Charlie will take care of Alice's dog while she's away.
I've eaten.
Jacob had no problem winning.
Joe and Laur told John they could do that today.
They are going to meet at the hotel tomorrow.
I don't know why I bother trying to help you.
Alex went to school with me.
Jacob studied French after dinner while his mother washed dishes.
I think everyone wants to do that.
I tried to sound out his views.
What's the plan?
He helped us out when he could.
Dan never saw any part of the castle.
I plan to go to the pool every day this summer.
Where do you sleep?
He didn't have time to spend with his children.
He says he'll quit doing that.
Jack begged me to wait.
Oliver said that he doesn't plan on going to that restaurant anymore.
Where has she learned Italian?
I heard that James really likes basketball.
Why did you quit?
It's foolish to think that smoking has little to do with cancer.
Eventually, George and Julia got married.
We need more volume.
Oliver and Margaret say that they still need help.
She told me that she'd like to help.
You're arguing just to argue.
I hope Tommy can figure out how to do that.
If you die, everyone dies.
I'm still eating.
Harry went back to his desk and sat down.
You never let me go anywhere by myself.
Charlie and Carmen must've forgotten that they'd already done that.
I'm not sure about that.
Tommy and John are sworn friends.
George let Monica escape.
You've got a one-size-fits-all answer.
Charlie said he knew that Monica wouldn't do that.
Tommy left Boston early on Monday morning.
Valentina said that she felt rejected.
Why did you want to go?
George wondered when the meeting would start.
Will she make a full recovery?
You should tell Tommy to come early.
What specifically are you looking for?
I just thought I'd ask.
She can leave if she wants.
Tommy gets off on that kind of thing.
I know that Oliver is hurt.
Tommy had no one to discuss his problems with.
I'm going to tell her that.
The car is white.
I'm the one who gave Tommy his nickname.
I'd be very glad if you came.
I go there all the time.
To defend myself, I had to tell a lie.
Instead of going to Boston, I want to go to Chicago.
Charlie doesn't feel like eating anything right now.
You were the only person that was ever nice to me.
We're wealthy.
Father is well as usual.
I recommend doing that the way Oliver suggested.
I have to help William. He's my own flesh and blood.
Culture is handed down from generation to generation.
I've been offered another job.
Aliens will land on Earth.
Laur says she needs to find somebody to help her.
The school is three miles from my house.
Everyone wants me to go, but I don't feel like going.
William talked about that.
Jacob said that he was done for the day.
She has a terror of darkness.
Charlie was a brave soldier.
I'm not answering that question.
More people came than we expected.
My hobby is playing golf.
He told me he'd be alone.
Neither Muhammad nor Carmen has been asked to leave.
Take this to your toys box.
Oscar and Eva said it was them who needed to do that.
The weak are food for the strong.
He refused my invitation.
You need to do that more quickly next time.
They want it for themselves.
You might want to tell that to James.
He is driving very fast.
I cried earlier today.
We need to get rid of all this stuff.
Alex knows that Monica is away.
It is almost ten o'clock.
I thought that we were just having drinks.
She spends all of her money on clothes.
If I were you, I'd call a doctor.
Oscar died of a heart attack in Australia.
You should be ashamed of your conduct.
I have my own bedroom at home.
I wonder whether we forgot to tell Olivia she was supposed to do that.
Monica said she thought Tommy was alone.
I know you aren't going to do that today.
Duty calls to me.
Harry's shirt was on his bed.
William and Eva promised John they'd help him with his homework.
In a foreign country most of us go through culture shock.
I suggest you wait until at least 2:30.
There's nothing left to tell.
Muhammad has overcome a lot.
Margaret was an extraordinary woman.
I came by taxi.
They're studying in their rooms now.
Jack was loaded into an ambulance.
It was really funny.
I told you that I couldn't be trusted with secrets.
I'm from Boston, but I live in Chicago.
A part of the country was at one time a French settlement.
Could you stand up, please?
Muhammad doesn't want to go to his company's Christmas do this year.
I don't think that we should be talking to each other.
Tommy got on the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor.
Let Jami do the washing.
Why didn't you make William stop?
I've already forgotten what you told me I should do.
Something always sticks.
Didn't you use to work at a hospital?
He would like to see you in his office.
William isn't doing a very good job today.
I know that George could probably be finished doing that by 2:30.
Please get in touch with me as soon as you arrive in Boston.
I wonder who the people I saw her with were.
I'm sure that Oscar is a very busy man.
I want to do that before Jacob gets here.
I'm the only one who can't do that.
Why did you leave us?
I began to feel dizzy.
I would often go swimming in the sea when a child.
Julia always drinks her coffee black.
There are too many of us to fit into one taxi.
I wanted to say more.
You are a good journalist.
What did you kiss me for?
My profits were just on paper.
I think that Muhammad could get Alice to do that.
Don't forget to clock out before you leave work.
Why are you still in Boston?
Adam asked me where to go.
Jack and Mary are coming to get us.
Charlie has a new bicycle.
Charlie didn't want Mary to know that he'd been in prison.
Oscar is obviously very rich.
I'm glad William and Emma are on our team.
I told Alex I was Eva's cousin.
The sun will soon set.
Adam turned the music off.
Tony is a very tall boy.
They say that they won't do that again.
Oliver said that he's glad that he was able to do that.
I knew Charlie wasn't a very good teacher.
He told me he was early.
Do you have a problem with any of this?
Tommy doesn't look even a little bit scared.
Take any one of these you like.
I know that you aren't ready to leave.
He's a baseball player.
I felt like talking to someone.
I immediately started crying.
Oscar said he doesn't plan on going hunting again.
Please be careful with this knife. It's very sharp.
I did not sleep well last night.
I know Muhammad doesn't know where Mary did that.
Find Jack and tell him to come here right away.
Jacob stabbed Mary with his knife.
The only language Alex knows how to speak is French.
How many of Emma's paintings have you sold for her?
Why don't you make yourselves comfortable?
They told me they left early.
My mother is beautiful.
We've known each other since we were children.
I'm supposed to meet George here in a few minutes.
The boys stole some apples from the tree.
Ken didn't know what to say next.
This is really helpful.
They spoke for more than three hours.
Who's the artist, if I may ask?
Jack did what he wanted to do.
I didn't want to do that myself.
Did you pay for those shoes?
I do not believe the weather will change for the worse next week.
No answer is also an answer.
Joe said that he's always been interested in music.
My hobby is collecting insects.
Could you get a ticket for me?
Please leave nothing behind.
I imagine that George and Margaret will eventually get married.
He is as good as dead.
He is not coming, either.
They explained their decision.
That was inevitable.
I've already done everything Oscar and Eva have asked me to do.
When do Alex and Alice have to go to Boston?
There are many Roman buildings in Rome.
I know I won't be able to change Alex's mind.
"Where is William?" "He's not working today."
I didn't catch what he said.
He immediately left us.
Do you think you can do that?
When are you going to trust me?
The policeman's quick arrival surprised us.
I had to walk home.
There's one cup of warm water on the table.
Who took me here?
He didn't have a scratch on him.
She wants us to die with her.
William told me that he couldn't do that by himself.
Where are my things?
They said they had to call the police.
I let the team down.
Jami said he'd never tell Margaret to do that.
If I don't come, who will?
I didn't know how to do that, so I asked William to tell show me how.
Is there anybody doing that now?
What's the real reason you don't want to go to Boston?
No one followed you.
Jack wasn't there last month.
William had not been expecting this.
I know you don't want me to interfere, but I have to defend her.
"How do you do, Mr James?" "Fine, thanks for asking. Nice to meet you."
We all have to die sooner or later.
Oscar said that he thought that the room was too cold.
Carmen might've left her umbrella in Joe's car.
I would like to know what you intend to do now.
Never have I seen such a smart child.
Let me do this.
James isn't seeing Mary.
Julia could buy everything she needed.
She has never gone on a date with him.
Ken runs fastest of the three.
The wind stopped.
There is a desk in this room.
It seems like the right thing to do.
I don't have any pain.
James asked Laur for her telephone number.
It was so cold yesterday that I stayed home.
I suggest you get a lawyer.
These gloves are mine.
Is something going on that I need to know about?
Joe's room stinks.
James didn't know how to ride a bicycle at that time.
This ticket is available for a whole year.
The guard thought they were joking until he saw their guns.
I think you've got it backwards.
William said that Carmen didn't look too busy.
James said that he owes Lucy $300.
Oscar says he's very hungry.
I'm going to Boston this week.
I don't think you're being objective.
Emma never wears the same clothes twice in a week.
Are you going to ask me or not?
How old is she now?
George is likely to still be downstairs.
I should tell Joe that he ought to do that.
I've never been robbed before.
Why did Oliver get into that car?
I don't trust banks.
His salary is low so he has to do odd jobs.
We're expecting to have this new rule applied from tomorrow.
Joe didn't know we were supposed to do that by ourselves.
Muhammad told me he was confused.
I lost my driving license.
Do you know what I think in this regard?
They eat a lot of rice.
George is never going to go back to Boston.
It's easier this way.
Please don't interrupt me for a while.
I no longer need to work.
Have Tommy and Catherine call me.
Alex let Valentina know that he didn't like to do that.
You should have seen what happened.
The story was so funny that I split my sides.
Joe is the only one I've told.
It seems that everybody's having fun.
I'm a level-headed person.
Adam said that he thought he might have to do that.
I think that it'll be interesting to see how much Muhammad can sell that painting for.
Valentina is a woman.
He was taken away by a policeman.
Today it's difficult to make ends meet.
I'm listening to her.
They hadn't eaten since morning.
I wasn't used to doing that.
Was Jami funny?
Adam and Carmen paid someone to help them move the piano.
Muhammad and Laur are here and they'd like to talk to you.
Remember to enjoy yourself.
Adam and Susie lost their land.
Does it show?
Adam is your neighbor's son, isn't he?
I didn't know it at the time.
Let's pretend that we're soldiers.
Jack didn't know where Eva wanted him to put her suitcase.
I'll never change my mind.
Jacob and Lucy aren't likely be punished for what they did.
I was there with her.
Adam is in the front.
Jami wants to marry me.
I caught up with them soon.
I'd have done that if I'd thought it was necessary.
He says he needs another computer.
Jack enjoyed Eva's story.
He never loses his head.
I don't think we should go this way.
I talked to her on the telephone.
Tommy is now in prison, isn't he?
The man that you saw there yesterday was Mr Brown.
They admitted that they were thieves.
I'm feeling a little under the weather today.
She fell on her face.
He visits us now and then.
Eva goes there whenever she has a chance.
Alex said he didn't know where he was supposed to go.
Funny how? Funny ha-ha or funny odd?
Alex has been to your place before, hasn't he?
Could you check that again, please?
George and Margaret told me they weren't going back to Boston.
James doesn't think Mary likes to do that.
Everyone has to start somewhere.
Are you still in the office?
There's no door.
It's obvious that James won't be able to do that without some help.
Joe and Margaret said they plan on going.
They're all gone now.
They live on the floor beneath.
They acted surprised.
Let's drink to Jack's success.
They would ask you about the party.
The quality of their products has gone down over the years.
I didn't know that the cost of living was so high in Australia.
You're my age.
I didn't know that what we were doing wasn't legal.
Jacob and Lucy wrapped the present they were going to give to John.
They didn't argue much.
As far as I know, Joe didn't break any rules.
I don't think I have enough money to buy everything I want to buy.
There is nothing you can do that I haven't already done to myself.
It's not so far-fetched.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
You've already decided not to go, haven't you?
Harry knows you can't do that.
They said they loved baseball.
You still don't do that, do you?
The call has come through.
George doesn't know when to keep quiet.
Don't you want to try?
Oliver almost never gets sick.
I need to go feed the chicken.
Yeah, I want you to do it.
I met an old friend of mine the other day.
Alex and Laur told John that they thought Alice was alone.
Can you fix a flat tire on a bike? That kind of thing's a piece of cake.
I'm pretty sure Adam doesn't know how to swim.
It's dry as dust.
Did you see my daughter?
If I'd had enough money, I would've bought that painting for you.
You may not like what you hear.
It's easy to do that, isn't it?
I've got to take a make-up test.
He has less bread.
That's my answer!
Did James and Mary say they'd eat with us?
He says he was fired.
Tommy has decided to start studying French.
They're always together.
Oscar and I often go to Australia.
I knew that Harry might get injured if he tried to do that.
This is my country, not yours.
That gave them an idea.
We expect Adam to do that on October 20th.
James stole his father's car.
Jack doesn't know who to ask.
I was in no hurry to do that.
I have to be in Australia on the 20th of next month.
I didn't do that because I didn't have any money.
It won't be long before Adam and Julia get here.
What'll happen to Jack now?
I haven't met Charlie's parents yet.
I don't want anyone to hear me.
Catherine was afraid someone would see her.
He looked like he was having fun.
I told Oscar not to buy a used car.
I know that that won't happen anytime soon.
You mean to say that the heat does not prevent you from playing football, but that it does prevent you from working?
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
I think that Jami might not wait for me.
I think it's worth the price.
Anna didn't deny that she was the one who did that.
Do you think he can really change?
You're the only other person who knows the combination to this safe.
I like to shop at that mall.
I don't know if Harry will be home this afternoon.
Millions of people lost all their savings.
Jacob and Laur told us they could help.
I really miss them.
You're the one who quit.
Susie ended up going by herself.
Don't you ever knock before you enter a room?
I'm pretty sure that Charlie and Laur are the only ones who don't want to do that.
This could be important.
Harry wanted to know what we expected to happen next.
There's a hair in the soup.
Jami told me he planned to wait until Monday to go.
Jim is not the man that you think him to be.
Adam said that he'd give Anna the book as soon as he finished reading it.
Can you please tell James I haven't made a mistake?
She stood silent, her head slightly to one side.
We need Harry's money.
This is where Jacob stays when he's in Australia.
I've got a sore throat.
Why don't you have a permit to do that?
Say it.
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
I came back home to eat a meal.
Muhammad said Olivia was worried about you.
You never even have to see Adam.
I was sorry to hear about him.
Joe said it's important that we help everybody we can.
You did a really good job.
Susie wore a beautiful evening gown to the party.
How much do you read?
I know that Tommy knows that Monica wanted to do that.
We'll be home all day tomorrow.
My only friends are love and courage.
How can you tell Jami and Lucy aren't happy?
Why can't you just call him?
Monica is hoping she doesn't get arrested.
Many people thought that the war would be over by Christmas.
My body still hurts, but that multi-day holiday trip was super fun!
I spent ten dollars on a book.
You'll do that with Jacob, right?
She said she's exhausted.
Valentina stayed there by herself.
You never expected to do that again, did you?
I called you back.
The thief ran away in the direction of the station.
I'd like to see some dancing. Do you have any information?
I thought you cared about her.
I really miss Boston.
Does Oliver teach history?
I think you should tell William where you are.
There is little hope that he will recover.
Is it a good investment?
How much weight has Tommy gained?
I have about three minutes.
William is the one who ought to do that.
I really should get some sleep.
It's not easy to teach little kids.
Neither Oliver nor Alice has found a job.
George is serving time in prison.
Let me buy this car.
I assumed James understood French.
I'm trying to do this.
He working all right.
People of my generation all think the same way about this.
You're not starting to believe this stuff, are you?
William will likely do that for Susie.
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
Tommy and Margaret didn't do it themselves.
I hope you have a good weekend.
I'm a construction worker.
Laur would be furious if she knew.
I want to help a lot of people.
What is your mission?
Jami is confused, but Carmen isn't.
Now I know what I should do.
Adam asked me to teach him how to ski.
Where is Father?
I'm sorry that it happened like this.
Neither Oscar nor Anna has enough time to do that.
As incredible as it seems, he is a really strong guy.
Did he say that?
She likes reading better than anything else.
Is this sentence meant seriously? Of course not!
I can't fire them.
We need a new plan.
Charlie says Monica isn't happy.
Do you want a receipt?
William doesn't like to see people fighting.
George probably doesn't want to do that again.
Can I count on her?
I can't live without her.
Under the new law, husbands can take days off to care for their children.
Nobody was crying.
William is trying to find Valentina a place to live.
We haven't seen them.
I don't want you involved.
"You must not be thinking about that," said the grandmother; "we are much better off and happier than human beings."
Go and get me some milk.
Harry said that he doesn't plan on doing that by himself.
Oliver said that he thought he shouldn't do that.
Joe knows that I don't often leave early.
Muhammad can be pretty convincing.
I'll make some coffee.
I know Joe doesn't know Valentina doesn't have to do that.
I knew there was a reason.
Something must be done.
Please turn off the light before you go to bed.
James doesn't think Eva will be frightened.
I didn't think Adam would come in this morning.
I've kind of gotten used to the weather.
I never thought George would want to do that.
Don't forget that Oliver doesn't understand French.
You don't even know how.
We never use them.
He's going from strength to strength.
Oscar doesn't really need to do that.
I'll have to talk to Jami about that.
I went to high school with Jack.
Charlie took shelter under the tree, hoping he wouldn't get too wet.
He was so intent on money-making that he had no time to think of anything else.
You know Tommy and Monica don't trust you.
Get me another doctor.
Oliver closed the door quietly.
I have the feeling that Harry doesn't know how to do that.
They say they're desperate.
When I was a child, I used to swim in that pond.
I drank some orange juice.
I have not an enemy in the world, as far as I know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?
Charlie didn't have any fun.
Not less than 40 percent of students go on to university.
Muhammad really thought we didn't have to do that.
People see things differently according as they are rich or poor.
Carmen knew what she was doing was wrong, but she did it anyway.
It's quite eye-catching.
You walk quickly!
It seems that the computer was infected by a virus.
Jacob is deaf, but he knows how to read lips.
Were Harry and Mary not supposed to tell me that?
Don't do anything else until I get there.
You will harvest your wheat in July.
It began to rain as we came near the pass.
Tommy came along at just the right time.
This is the best gift I've ever gotten.
I've never seen one like that.
What do I care what he thinks?
I laughed.
I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
I can explain why I need it.
I'm not concerned with the details.
Nowadays many people travel by car.
This question is one of great importance.
Everyone got up to leave.
It's not necessary to bring a gift.
Tommy and Mary can swim, can't they?
May I turn on the radio?
Jacob is looking for his shoes.
Do you like basketball?
We should give Adam some time by himself.
I know this is difficult to accept.
Why would I care where Muhammad and Monica are?
What do you know about Monica's boyfriend?
Muhammad, I want you to know that you're not alone.
Maybe we should help them.
Why did you give yourself up?
Charlie is in there with Susie and John.
I wonder whether Muhammad really wanted us to be here.
I couldn't have done that alone.
Oscar finally got back on track.
George said that Monica was certain that he had to do that.
We're going to die.
Adam may have to cancel the picnic.
You didn't see anything.
I never had the chance to talk with James.
I'll check back.
He lived next to his uncle.
He told me the same thing.
Jack has been giving Margaret money.
Jack is being very brave, isn't he?
It's illegal to do that here.
We're not going to do this anymore.
I think you'll appreciate it.
Can you tell us what possessed you to do that?
Adam wasn't surprised, but Monica was.
Muhammad and Anna admitted that they'd been drinking.
James realized we needed to do that.
Oscar and Monica may get injured if they do that.
Nobody wants to mention my country.
Harry put off going to Australia.
Jack bought a ticket for Susie.
I had a great time here.
He found his key under the sofa.
I can't eat pork.
Charlie and Anna didn't do that because they didn't want to.
I want to speak with her.
Jami could have been lonely, but even if he was, he wouldn't have told us.
George didn't know that Valentina wanted to do that with him.
They told me that they were prepared.
When did you last look someone in the eyes?
The rain is starting to let up.
Is it true that it's easy to get laid in Japan?
Oliver doesn't seem particularly interested in Margaret.
Let's take a short rest here. My legs are tired and I can't walk any more.
Tommy bent down and picked something up.
Oliver and Emma are unusual.
I try to get up at six.
If you want to include other information, please let us know.
Charlie said he thought that Valentina was married.
I know that Oliver knows Anna's not supposed to be doing that.
Music is her passion.
I suggest we go outside and see what's happening.
Jami was the only one not laughing.
I thought Oscar was supposed to be here for three weeks.
Take it as it comes.
Tommy is very familiar with the system.
Unfortunately, I'm too busy right now.
You'll have to talk to Tommy about that.
I met Joe in Boston last year.
She spoke above her breath.
I didn't want to surprise you.
I slept for the rest of the day.
I can't work with them.
I will finish it by the time he comes back.
May I use the bathroom?
William didn't see it that way.
They gave a big party for me.
I'd like to know who took those pictures.
The clerk didn't take much trouble over the work.
He began to study with a will.
Jacob and Lucy said they'd buy that for you.
I want to know what you're doing.
Alex was finally able to do that.
We've got to take off.
Everyone sit down.
How many times will you have to go to the dentist?
How long have you already spent in Boston?
You had a good weekend, didn't you?
William told me that he doesn't know what to do.
It would be impossible to do that by yourself.
It proved to be effective.
Oliver wasn't the one who told Lucy she didn't have do that.
Oliver passed away yesterday.
Jami was unable to help me.
Joe and Lucy said they understood French.
It doesn't make him happy.
Jami let the air out of Olivia's tires.
What did you want me to do?
Tommy wasn't killed in the explosion.
How did you manage to escape?
Why don't you ask for a pay raise?
Both Muhammad and Laur know what you're doing.
Don't talk to anyone.
Were you crying?
For my breakfast today: fried egg on toast with cheese.
Both William and Valentina can't drive.
Charlie likes to do that with Alice.
I'll be glad to make you happy!
He's supposed to be dead.
James was curious, but Mary wasn't.
I've learned a lot with her over the years.
They are human.
He is the man I saw yesterday.
Who are the most important people in your life?
James doesn't know that you're here, does he?
I'm pretty sure that Muhammad won't buy that car he was looking at yesterday.
He said he noticed the same thing.
We still have some work to do.
Tommy wanted to own a restaurant.
Oscar and Olivia did more than their share.
The only person who could have done this is Jack.
Oliver is Margaret's youngest son, isn't he?
Jami drowned in the river.
I'm not coming back for a while.
Tommy is lucky to be here.
Everyone, out of the water!
Harry and Anna didn't tell me they were married.
Have you read any of Jami's stories?
We are all alone.
Jack doesn't have many photos of himself as a baby.
Muhammad has a funny way of laughing.
Straighten up.
He's just evil.
Adam was in a great hurry.
I know that I can do that if you help me.
I needed to eat.
Margaret said she didn't ever want to do that again.
I'd like to have a girl the first time. Look, they say 'First a girl, then a boy' don't they?
It was very cold last night.
All I want is some breakfast.
Please buy me something to eat.
You didn't buy that, did you?
I want you to be an Einstein.
No one was in the lobby.
They couldn't believe their ears.
Someone is calling for help.
In the morning I usually drink coffee, in the evening I drink tea.
Harry's dad is a university professor.
I no longer need your help.
It is how it is.
It's a matter of vital importance.
Did you know Jami is good at speaking French?
Tommy wanted to adopt you.
And then everyone started singing.
I thought I could deal with it.
Alex usually gets home before dark.
Alex was always happy.
It isn't necessary to do that again.
Tommy will turn thirty in October.
Thanks for the fruit.
Don't forget that all of us are in the same boat.
Jacob bought a pair of work gloves.
You are such a boring person.
Let's play another game.
It takes patience.
Oscar is popular with both students and teachers.
Do you know how much of a loss it was?
Take your hands off James.
She had an individual style of speaking.
What made you think we could trust Charlie?
I think everything here is under control.
Oliver picked the magazine up.
I've been in this situation before.
Nobody invited Joe, but he came anyway.
He's extremely romantic.
Who will believe us now?
Charlie and I lost touch after we graduated.
She didn't deserve to lose her job.
Joe said he thought it would be a big mistake to tell Mary about what had happened.
There is a hole in his sock.
Harry told me that he was lonely.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
You're so tense.
I'm meeting Joe for lunch.
We're coming to pick her up.
He might do that by himself.
A toilet is made for taking shit, not for smoking!
Is it really true that George wants me to do that?
Why is everyone crying?
What are Joe and Anna scared of?
Alex and Alice don't want to see the same movie.
Harry wasn't the one who told Monica not to do that.
Jack hasn't been told not to do that yet.
I hope everyone has a great time.
She did not agree to the proposal.
Alex doesn't seem to have noticed.
The American boy spoke broken Japanese.
Joe spent the rest of his life in Boston.
William said that he wanted something cold to drink.
Why would someone kill Oliver?
I hope you've enjoyed yourselves.
Did you remember to turn off the gas?
I would've gone with you if you'd invited me.
Could this help?
Suddenly I hit on a happy idea.
Emma realized there was nothing she could do to help.
It will have been raining for a week by tomorrow.
I am out of work.
A bear will not touch a corpse.
Joe made it clear that he didn't like Margaret.
I doubt if I'll get a chance to do that.
You won't find anyone who'll do that for you.
Nobody knows Harry as well as I know him.
Can you tell me where Jami and Mary live?
Harry shouldn't be allowed to compete.
He runs well for his age.
This old man is gray.
Why didn't you want to go to Australia?
Charlie did something bad again.
He has money, but he's not happy.
We'll certainly try.
They said they like teaching French.
I wonder whether or not Jacob is impressed.
I recommend you to go by train.
Nobody saw Alex leave the room.
Harry wanted to do that last week.
Muhammad didn't seem to know we were all going to Boston next week.
I don't think Joe and Carmen know exactly how much it'll cost.
Jacob sat next to me in church.
Alex said that he sold Lucy his car.
I believe that everything will be fine.
I didn't like Boston at all.
I do everything by hand.
Remember not to tell anyone.
That would take too long.
I also like cake.
I knew Alex would volunteer.
I do that about three hours every day.
What kind of books do William and Emma like to read?
Alex said that he wanted something else to eat.
Why don't you open it?
I can't lie to Alex again.
Susie isn't doing that the way she was told to.
Did you know that Tommy could speak French?
Harry announced that he wasn't going to do that.
Close your eyes when you listen to music!
He said he'd been busy.
You noticed it, too, didn't you?
He carried his son on his back.
At least six hundred men died in action.
Charlie didn't come into work yesterday.
George said that he shouldn't do that.
Jacob doesn't know either Carmen or her sister.
Susie gave Muhammad a pipe for his birthday.
Eva was the first one who said she'd like to do that.
James said that he didn't think that he ought to do that.
Jami is still a bartender.
I've got the habit to cook for myself.
James said that he wanted to make sure we didn't make the same mistake he did.
You should be more careful how you talk to people.
Jami has already finished his homework.
We won't come to Boston next week.
James is taking a walk in the park.
Are you and Muhammad both from Australia?
They said they'd been offered $3,000.
I went on sleeping because the alarm didn't go off.
I don't want Joe to know what we did.
Adam died shortly afterwards.
William said you wanted me to come here.
Keep working.
I don't think that Alex needed to do that outside.
Maybe I can fix it.
I assume you know what this is about.
I am not used to hard work.
Where's my husband?
I thought the festival was over.
George told Carmen that he didn't have anything to do.
I don't mind if you use my desk.
William and Eva are always blaming themselves.
These people were very lucky.
I'll wait up for her.
Charlie gave me the key and I still have it.
I wonder what made Oliver think Catherine didn't need to do that?
The mere sight of blood makes him faint.
There are people who prefer standing room in first class to a seat in second class.
We need to work together in order to make the world a better place.
I don't think that I've slept enough.
I haven't seen her since I was a child.
William said he hoped he wasn't going to get fired.
I'll get us some drinks.
There was a traffic accident in front of the house yesterday.
Maybe we should tell them.
Jacob listened to what Olivia was saying.
Julia said she felt fantastic.
I saw her yesterday.
It was a bright and clear Sunday morning.
I'm sitting here with Oliver.
I share his opinion.
Is Muhammad outside?
She said 'I love you' to me.
You're patient, aren't you?
She has no more pain.
Jack often plays baseball with other boys in his neighborhood.
I know you don't want to be here.
I don't think you need to tell Oliver why you have to do that.
All Jack needed was money.
I started learning French three years ago.
What we need now is a break.
We only have three options.
You must allow for his youth.
I think he's making a big mistake by turning down the job.
This problem seems difficult.
I don't think that James and Margaret were in Boston last week.
Stay and watch.
I saw Alex standing there all by himself.
I remained standing.
Many paintings hang in the shop.
Do you think Alex is ready for this?
I am seeking a person who can write a personal computer manual.
If my brother hadn't helped me, I would have drowned.
James hit me back.
Stop watching TV and start studying.
George said it wouldn't be difficult to do that.
I want to watch the film.
I'd think you'd understand what that means.
Just don't tell anybody.
We are going to leave tomorrow.
Can I hug you?
She came to Japan as a child.
I know that Jack knows that I want to do that.
I had to stop a few times.
Adam needs to let off some steam.
He decided not to use much energy in his daily life.
I remember it!
I'm so embarrassed, I want to die.
I'm going to do everything you've asked me to do.
He is too proud to ask others any question.
How many hours is the flight?
Where is my dad?
Joe helped Julia move the sofa to other side of the room.
I know that you don't trust us.
He's an Asian-American.
James said that he thought Alice might need to do that again.
Who doesn't know such a common saying?
She's apples.
I think this is a great idea.
Let's play twenty questions.
We know God's plan was different.
Most people won't tell you what they really think.
I'll look it over after I come back.
I miss you so much!
Oscar is out hunting.
Jacob is looking for help.
Madrid is the capital of Spain and its most important city.
I couldn't contain my excitement.
Tommy didn't bother to respond.
"123456" is a frequently-used password.
My e-mail address will be changed effective Aug. 1 as follows.
Don't expect me to lose any sleep over it.
I had some problems dealing with Alex.
Everyone is looking forward to next year.
He did serious effort, in order to pass an examination.
Their traces can still be found.
I think Adam and Anna are sleeping.
He's quite able at his job.
I think that Joe went to Boston last week.
It's nothing compared to what he did.
To my regret, my father could not recover from his long illness.
I might be in Boston all next week.
It wasn't much of a storm.
I think Oscar is distracted.
It's bad manners to do that.
They said that they're jealous.
I'm still learning to do that.
Jacob said that he thought that Margaret wasn't in Australia.
Your hair is different today.
Come here this minute.
No one cares about that anymore.
Tell Jacob that Emma wants to see him.
I need to go get some money out of the bank.
I'm someone ambitious - someone who knows very well what she is after.
You're jealous, aren't you?
I don't want to leave early.
I came to hear you speak.
Jacob and Emma adopted a girl from China.
He always spends his money freely.
If you want me to play the piano, I'll play the piano.
I don't know why Charlie and Valentina are afraid of me.
I saw him go inside.
You knew James didn't have to do that anymore, didn't you?
I'm a different man.
They told me that they were sleepy.
Muhammad had a long day.
Muhammad and Lucy weren't having a very good time.
I wasn't alone then.
She's an alcoholic.
George said that Eva thought he might be allowed to do that by himself.
I'll help you, on one condition.
Oliver will get another chance.
You should be sleeping.
James couldn't do what needed to be done.
Do you wear glasses?
Jami should've been in contact by now.
You have at least three options.
I think that George can swim fairly well.
Anna almost wished she'd never met Tommy.
Jack is working too hard.
Do you know anyone here?
Maybe I should check on her.
We'd never do anything to hurt you.
I carried one.
Adam has had enough of Carmen's complaints.
He looks like he's conscious.
I will never change my mind.
I assume after work you're going home right away.
I waited for Jami till it got dark.
Jami and Laur said that they'd do that soon.
Leave Oscar alone.
You don't sound confident.
The only thing Tommy and Margaret ever do is complain.
Charlie said that Alice is in the hospital.
Jack thinks Anna will be interested.
Carmen never got out of her car.
You have a son named Alex, don't you?
Compare the translation with the original.
I don't think that Harry knows why Eva is scared.
Jack looked like he wasn't in a hurry to get home.
Close that door.
Does any of that sound bad?
Who do you like to spend weekends with?
That's so tragic.
They've put the value of the estate at three hundred thousand dollars.
You should have stayed away.
You know I don't often do that, don't you?
I might get back home today.
That's probably a new record.
I haven't seen William in three days.
Adam and Valentina said that they might be able to help.
Many people spend more than they earn.
I know both Alex and Susie have to leave.
Are you from a planet on which only women live?
Who would do something like that?
We named the dog White.
I never really understood what happened.
The problem is worse.
Tommy and Valentina said they had no money.
The sentence was short.
He says that he won't cry.
She was in time for the bus.
I think Jami is probably older than you think he is.
This water is safe to drink.
Jacob is on board the ship.
Charlie wanted to be the last one to do that.
I must find her.
Why don't we all go to Boston together?
He closed his eyes and made a wish.
Is it possible to drink salt water?
The mass used to be said in Latin.
Tommy has just been given another chance.
I knew you wouldn't accept Alex's invitation.
We'll have to make do with what we have.
I knew that I was going to be late.
At this second lie, his nose grew a few more inches.
James told Valentina that he didn't think John was asleep.
I know George knew Alice had never done that.
I know Adam doesn't know exactly how to do that.
Big Brother is watching you.
Joe said that the passengers' injuries were minor.
Jami and Laur know that they've done something bad.
Oliver and Mary said they thought they might not have to do that here.
I haven't seen you in such a long time.
I don't know whether Adam will come tomorrow or not.
She's so young.
I didn't think you'd dance.
At the same time, he began to run.
Oliver isn't the one who showed Margaret how to do that.
I can't stay in bed for the entire pregnancy.
You have very steady hands.
Ask your question.
I hear you don't have to go to Australia.
I'm never going to be able to do this without your help.
It's not you I hate.
Monica said she was all worn out.
Apparently, Jacob is still alive.
I gave Muhammad a bribe.
Tell me right now who that was and what they were looking for!
She is very sad.
I just can't figure them out.
Hopefully they don't delay my flight like the others.
You should keep your promises.
Harry doesn't think we can trust Julia as much as we used to.
If you could tell me when George will arrive, I'll go to the station and pick him up.
It's not that difficult.
Do you need to go?
People like Harry.
You aren't supposed to be doing that.
Muhammad says there isn't time to do that.
He succeeded in business.
Harry told me you were the one to talk to.
He admitted he wasn't perfect.
Oliver didn't want to tell Eva how to do that.
I cannot correct this sentence. I don't know Polish.
He feels hurt.
This train is bound for New York.
James and Lucy said that they couldn't believe anyone.
What colour do you like?
She sucks up to the teacher.
I can't get you out of my head.
He just left, but he'll be back.
The ship was at the mercy of the wind and the waves.
I don't have to know why.
You're free to go, of course.
I know where I'm going next.
We have not received a letter from him so far.
Oliver told me that he didn't eat meat.
Adam gave me some good advice.
Alex soon realized Carmen wasn't joking.
She told me she was pleased.
What about having fish for dinner?
I don't feel like walking.
Was it you who told James and Catherine they shouldn't do that?
Dan forgot himself and told the truth.
I can't give any more of an answer than that.
Don't say that about her. She's my girlfriend.
Does Oscar have children?
She has made her choice.
Different people went to different places in America.
Revenge is a confession of pain.
It took a long time for her to write the report.
How do I get to ...?
I think something horrible is about to happen.
Anna said she hopes Tommy will help her.
Muhammad is a young student.
I haven't spoken to Tommy since I left Boston.
How often do you hear that?
Her dream has come true.
It's a fact.
Harry will definitely help me do that.
I saw land in the distance.
Oscar isn't smart enough to win.
She thrilled at the thought that she would meet the famous singer.
I know Charlie is used to be a basketball coach.
We'd better wash up.
How many bottles of beer should we buy?
I hate it when she sucks her teeth.
I understand the situation.
When will your father arrive?
Muhammad'll manage.
I can't hear Harry.
If you find money on the street, you should take it to your local police department.
It's been raining for almost a week.
Jami said that he thought that Carmen would be able to help him.
It's clear that it's so.
William said he wished that he hadn't done that.
This is it. It's over!
When did I realize I was God? Well, I was praying and I suddenly realized I was talking to myself.
He's staying with his uncle.
Let's hope you haven't made a mistake.
She is not beautiful.
I'm not as rich as you think I am.
William wanted a fresh start.
I think it's a very good deal.
Let me explain myself.
James doesn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's dead. It's official.
We wanted to do it right away.
I'll take it all.
He didn't offer thanks for the good harvest.
Something is obviously not right with Harry.
How much more weight do you want to lose?
It's difficult to please Oscar.
An offer like that is not to be refused.
Oscar is pretty skinny, isn't he?
Adam told me to meet him at the restaurant next to the hotel.
Charlie and Carmen wouldn't tell John why they did that.
I like the old car more than the new.
I still go out with her.
Tell us what we're doing wrong.
This young person's hair is blue.
Are you sure we're talking about the same person?
Don't stick your fingers behind the door. I might crush them when I close it.
I think it looks cool.
Oliver's grandfather died last Monday.
Oliver said that he was going to go yesterday.
Alex said that he thought Carmen was afraid.
I might vote for him.
She said that she's been here before.
I have mentioned it to you before.
Because of the storm, we couldn't search for the lost child.
I took time off from work and went to the hospital.
She admitted that she was terrified.
I'm not as good at French as you.
Do it again, the same as last time.
I asked Joe if he wanted to do that.
The matter should be tried in public.
She is terrified of her father.
If George had more money, he wouldn't work.
What are you offering?
I made this for you.
I have to study tonight.
It could get embarrassing.
That is nice.
I suspect that James is likely to do that while he's in Boston.
I'm on a hockey team.
This is the best season for doing that.
Now, come over here.
We haven't yet been informed of the committee's decision.
They said that they were really happy.
James has known Margaret since he was a little boy.
Tommy went out to look for something to eat.
Muhammad lives a long way from here.
Alice has always had a bit of a temper.
For some reason, he wasn't able to be completely honest.
I don't understand why I need to do that.
New York City is known for its tall buildings.
Was that an invitation?
We're moving to Boston in a year.
I don't have a family yet.
He held the trophy on high.
It's hot in here, isn't it?
That white building is a morgue.
I'm going to call him right now.
This could all be for nothing.
It's not my problem. It's Jacob's.
I don't think that Adam will be doing that anytime soon.
Stay down!
I think that Joe will do that later.
Why won't anyone eat my potatoes?
We all want changes.
You are watching TV all the time.
Muhammad isn't going to hang out with us today.
I thought that Muhammad might not want to go with us.
Jami thought I wanted him to help me do that.
I'll fill you in sometime.
I was told by my teacher to hand my homework by Friday.
Maybe Muhammad can explain what happened here.
Although there's little chance of success, let's try it.
Can you help me solve a mystery?
I didn't know Jacob and Alice were doctors.
I know that Harry isn't a very lucky guy.
James's birthday is in October and mine is in November.
I'm from Canada.
Tommy made friends with everybody he met.
Tommy is boring the pants off us.
I promise you that it won't last long.
Tommy asked me what I thought he should do.
Just like the Earth, half of the Moon is lit by the Sun while the other half is in darkness.
We have supper at six every evening.
Everyone agreed to a certain extent.
Such is the custom of the people here.
I wonder why Adam and Mary are so dirty.
Harry is going to tell you the same thing I did.
That seems weird to me.
About how many books did you read last year?
They were absolutely sure of themselves.
Stop playing the fool.
We have to address that problem.
I wanted to scream.
It's a great opportunity for Joe.
You can't run from the past.
I don't think Harry will be coming to Australia with me.
Does Tommy know what Margaret is going to do next year?
I stayed at home because I have got flu.
Adam isn't religious.
Did you say 30?
I told William to do whatever he wants.
That really does happen sometimes.
Why don't you trust us?
Alex said he's really glad that he moved to Australia.
Three people can keep a secret so long as two of them are dead.
She asked for divorce because she's always beaten.
I don't think Joe and Catherine have ever gone swimming together.
Muhammad likes to watch baseball on TV.
Harry almost died when he was in Australia.
Take your dog away.
It seems you have a different opinion.
Harry asked me to pass him the salt and pepper.
It'll take longer than ten minutes.
He said he could come get it.
Let's do only one thing at a time.
That dog is so stupid.
Jacob is much more dangerous than we thought.
I cooked supper last night.
Because of you, everything went to pot.
I want to use this.
Muhammad won't be allowed to do that.
I don't know why I even thought you might consider helping.
Would you leave your wife for me?
I know it's wrong to do that, but I'll do is anyway.
I'll come back the evening after next.
Don't expect everyone to share that opinion.
This forest is quiet and peaceful.
He said he didn't smoke anymore.
Please fill this bucket with water.
Did Oliver really want to do that?
Oscar and Julia were told that they need to do that.
Do you think Oscar was able to do that?
I will introduce you to my parents.
I know that Joe is a good friend of Emma's.
I don't think I'll kiss Jacob anymore.
Muhammad said Lucy was likely to still be nervous.
He wants to be a scientist in the future.
She says she doesn't have a lawyer.
Tommy thought he wouldn't be able to do that for me.
They were moving.
The question is how to say no without making Jacob mad.
I can't ever be what you were.
Keep to the speed limits!
Adam said he might cry.
I've been out of the office for the past three days.
Now, let's eat.
We have to go back for him.
The ending wasn't a surprise.
You ought to tell Jacob that you aren't planning on doing that.
They voted Muhammad out.
Bite me.
Please give me some advice on what I should do.
Oscar is a typical teenager.
They said that they didn't enjoy doing that.
Did you learn a lot?
You may act as you wish.
Muhammad said that he doesn't think Catherine had to do that.
Jami said the report was false.
Is there any hope that Jack will come?
Don't go anywhere alone, OK?
I thought I did something to make you upset.
That's a problem you have to handle by yourself.
Oliver would do that whenever he could.
What day is tomorrow?
Don't let her down now.
Everyone is staring at us.
We're not finished.
I think William might actually want someone to kill him.
Tell us what happened to her.
Have you called the boss already?
You have my permission to try.
Do you think that George is still busy?
Do not yell into my ear.
While I was waiting for the bus, I saw a traffic accident.
The Indian girl in the film isn't a professional actress.
Please don't touch me.
What did Harry bury?
Your wife has seen the need to look for work.
You're a good soldier.
I didn't think that Jacob really planned to do that.
Jami asked Olivia to help us.
Did you tell everybody all about me?
What a wonderful gift!
James gave Lucy what little money he had.
You sing a lot better than I do.
That's what we've got to figure out.
Julia may eat as much as she wants.
Jami let Julia speak.
They blamed everybody except themselves.
Tommy regrets that he couldn't do that.
William's wife left him.
I'm surprised that Oliver and Monica don't know how to speak French.
Do you know what Oliver and Catherine are talking about?
I wonder which one I should choose.
Adam wants us working.
They arrived just in time for the last train.
I'm not mad at George.
Did you spend the night here?
It's true that she knows a lot about cooking, but she isn't a good cook.
He has no interest whatsoever in money.
Your room is very big.
I know that you won't be busy all day tomorrow.
Let's go to Australia together.
I didn't know Muhammad had a cat.
I wish I could've stuck around for a few more hours.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
We both have the same favorite colors.
They said that they want to talk to you.
I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep on the bus.
Let's be more careful this time.
Why don't we drop over to see her?
George would have missed the train if he had stopped to buy a chocolate bar.
I just wanted to hear your voice.
Oscar and his friends sat on the beach and watched the boys swimming.
You were the only one who could have helped us.
George checked his pants pockets.
You must not live beyond your means.
I have a pain in the shoulder.
James is going to be fired, isn't he?
Jack and Olivia said that they thought it would be possible to do that.
Do you want to go run around the track with me?
He said he wants to be a mechanic.
I'll be late to work.
They are in great condition.
I cannot whistle.
All mountains are not green.
I hope Harry doesn't tell Carmen what we did.
I think Oliver will probably be able to do that.
The shoes are the same size.
I thought that Tommy would tell Eva how to do that.
George can't just do whatever he wants.
I only saw him once.
He soon left the new job.
I'm pleased with the result.
I'll see you at nine tomorrow morning.
Jami is determined to find out why that happened.
I wake up with difficulty.
I didn't know that Harry knew why we couldn't do that for him.
Anna said she didn't know Joe wasn't able to do that.
This is an easy sentence.
George was a drug addict.
How has Charlie changed?
Adam is in a coma, but he's stable.
Carmen wouldn't allow William to kiss her.
I want to give you my heart for ever.
I've waited for three hours already.
Alex isn't likely to let you do that.
Charlie said that it's not going to end well.
I'll clean up the house before my parents come.
He was surprised at the sight of blood.
He was engaged in medical research.
I'll soon give you an address where to send it.
I can't help but think we're doing this wrong.
Carmen said it was more harder than she expected.
Julia didn't want anybody to find out about her and Alex.
Where did you get all that money from?
Joe says he thinks he should do that.
I love candy.
I got some good second-hand books today.
Jack would make a good dad.
Tommy knew it was time to leave.
This lesson is cancelled tomorrow.
I think that William will be frightened.
Valentina was lucky we were here to help her.
If you didn't know, now you know.
I translate only articles, not books.
Jack isn't going to let Carmen get to him.
Alex isn't supposed to be sleeping.
I really want to know why William didn't do that.
Shall we start studying?
You don't have to do that, do you?
This might not be a very good idea.
I don't think Oscar wants to go to Australia with me.
Muhammad locked himself in the closet.
I cannot swear at a policeman.
The hotel burned down.
Can you remember the first time you saw Jacob?
I thought you could use this.
How much longer do I need to do this?
They've lost their touch.
He is twice as old as I.
The sun is already up.
I can't tell you how unhappy that makes me.
Muhammad and Margaret have already left Boston.
He's always joking.
Oliver admitted he was desperate.
What do we tell her?
Honour the face of the old man.
My world is your world too.
Kill me with words!
Charlie and Eva are on a very tight schedule.
George has been like this for a very long time.
The next day I came back, and I had a new waitress.
Tommy told me that he's grateful for all our help.
You yourself have to finish it.
He was put to death finally.
I think that you shouldn't have done that by yourselves.
You'd better be careful what you say.
George admitted that he didn't know how to do it.
You have a very nice family.
What I'm about to say will answer your question.
Hope isn't a strategy.
It's a military club.
Monica isn't still doing that, is she?
We will be best friends forever.
I gave him a set of keys.
Valentina says that doesn't matter to her.
Jack has found a solution to that problem.
Jami said he thought Valentina would prefer red wine.
How soon can we get away from here?
Harry and Carmen knew that they wouldn't be able to pass the test.
Do you think Jack and Emma are ready to do that?
What is it that having one voice becomes four-legged and two-legged and three-legged?
Adam will probably be objective.
What time will you arrive tomorrow?
He'll be a good doctor.
I removed one.
I didn't need to do that, but I wanted to.
Get ready quickly.
I sure am cold.
He went over the house.
I thought that you would do that.
Tommy seemed aggressive.
My birthday was yesterday.
I've already told Harry not to do that anymore.
It's a good movie.
I don't want to fight with you.
Do I smell cookies?
What country were you born in?
Where did she buy that cap?
They closed the doors.
I tried to write with the left hand.
Jami went in there.
She can't make her own decisions.
Muhammad knows what's happening.
I want to find out what Alex did yesterday.
Is there something we can do?
I'm sure Adam is grateful for your support.
Take a picture of me.
Muhammad looked around to see if he was being followed.
It was absolutely brilliant.
Do you still think that's all I have to do?
How is he getting along with his school work?
Not having received a reply, he wrote to her again.
Who was with you?
May I ask you a favor?
They spoke quietly.
I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving.
Don't you want to eat?
He can't make a decision.
Emma said she likes this time of year.
James and Alice seem to be having trouble making up their minds.
You should be packing your suitcase right now.
Charlie knows that something's going on.
I am either going to see a film, or going to see an opera.
I thought the nightmare was over.
Neither Oliver nor Olivia is likely to do that.
Jami is going to get back from Boston on Monday.
Has something else happened?
He asks for your opinion.
I feel that I should help you.
I wanted to become a doctor.
Alice should probably tell Harry why she had to do that.
Joe says that he doesn't usually wear underwear.
What kind of a sick joke is this?
This is a portrait of my late father.
It was raining today. What'll it be like tomorrow?
There's something I need to give you.
William couldn't close the door.
These flowers bloom in the spring.
I'll take my chances with him.
Oscar should have told Anna that she needed to do that.
If you want just to get some points, play a game.
We have nothing in common.
Muhammad did a lot more than that.
Get down from there.
That sick person's life is in danger.
There is no time like the present.
Do you want Alex to go to Australia?
Alex could quit if he wanted to.
We planned a party for them.
My watch runs too fast.
The ship stopped a little way off the shore.
I understand the problem.
Carmen has said she should do that.
You know you need do that, don't you?
Adam called his parents to let them know that he was in the hospital
Joe is mistaken, isn't he?
Why do William and Monica cry so much?
I went to the dance with Valentina.
Aren't you getting a divorce?
She gave me a beautiful clock, but I lost it.
Could you give me a card with this hotel's address?
Why are you protecting him?
Oliver will have to do that.
It was very cold.
Margaret is going to be in her office all morning.
That may not happen.
A dog bit her leg.
Let's give Alex the benefit of the doubt.
We have to look at the results.
Check out the woman over there!
Do you think Harry would likely do that for us?
What'll it cost you?
Get out! You can't play here.
Jacob and I'll come together.
Do you know what's going to happen to Alex?
I have a wife and kids.
I owe a lot to my coach.
I've told you a million times.
He said he won't sing tonight.
George and Eva said that they'd like to see more.
That is all.
They look like they're upset.
Muhammad asked Julia why she thought that wasn't a good idea.
He carried a knife or something similar.
It's easier to teach children than adults.
I've been patient all week.
Nobody wants Jami.
Whatever words you have, just say them.
I didn't poison Joe.
Jack was surprised I couldn't do that.
Today I received a splendid news.
I think it's good for you to read this book.
Mary is coming next Monday, isn't she?
I'd like bread and butter, please.
What a big dog it is!
Jami doesn't need to tell me what to do. I already know.
The cook is sitting in the kitchen.
Maybe Adam can go to Boston.
James deserved the prize.
She looked at the sky.
A funny thing happened to me today!
Of course, you may.
Don't turn the light off.
I think she's looking at you.
I wouldn't miss it for the world!
I should be out of the hospital by next Monday.
Margaret's husband is a lot older than she is.
They say that they're not thirsty.
Charlie wasn't my client.
I wish Oscar would do that for us.
I didn't know that you could do that by yourselves.
He is willing to stand by you.
Tommy is likely to be retired by now.
Do you have a gift shop here?
Tommy said he'd expected Lucy to do that on Monday.
When did you read this book?
Once in a while he tells strange things.
I like a lot the sound and rhythm of your translation.
How big is the company?
She beat the shit out of me with a baseball bat.
If only he would marry me.
They took their keys out of their pockets.
A majority of the people here can do that.
I should have gone to the dentist last week.
I'm sure Adam won't be organized.
You think you're better than me, don't you?
They offered their sincere apologies.
You aren't suggesting Jami did that, are you?
Jacob didn't argue with me.
I am reading the label.
Did you invite him to dinner?
I'm sleepy, so I'm leaving now.
I saw Muhammad in the hall.
Your way of doing things will have an effect on your future.
Is it hot over there?
I thought that I did that well.
This gift is from Jack.
Joe said that he thought Eva wouldn't be scared.
You should have said yes.
The shock was terrible.
I haven't read today's paper yet.
You're not the only one!
Neither Harry nor Carmen has denied cheating.
Isn't it a wonderful morning? The world looks like something God had just imagined for His own pleasure.
I don't know why Oscar doesn't want me to help him.
Don't let them escape!
You've got to carry a gun in this area.
It's on the ground floor.
I don't think Muhammad knows anything about Australia.
What shall we do afterwards?
She told me that she had a problem.
They told me they'd do it.
There is a knife missing.
Perhaps you'd better drive.
I didn't think Jack and Anna were difficult to get along with.
There's a lot of familiar words.
William came to see me three days ago.
My grandfather was a justice of the peace.
Jacob never hurt anybody.
That's a bit of a problem.
He's losing his balance.
Adam will need medical attention.
It's all delicious!
I usually take a shower first thing in the morning.
I can't believe you'd be so stupid.
Oscar said that I should ask Valentina to eat dinner with us.
What's your favorite way to travel?
Keep dancing.
Adam said that he's really glad he moved to Boston.
This key won't go in the lock.
I knew that it wasn't true.
I'm not young like her.
I never did!
I was shocked by the price.
Oscar couldn't afford to do that.
William is going to paint his car.
We were able to do that.
What did Susie say she lost?
Oscar immediately reported the theft.
You must behave yourself like a man.
I like Oliver too.
Repeat it, please.
Muhammad has been to Australia before.
"What if I miss the deadline?" "I bet he will get mad at you!"
I'll give it to her.
I thought you were a man.
Learn this lesson by heart.
That's so cool!
This was a gift from Adam.
She was within an ace of saying "I don't know".
Alex said that Anna was wrong.
Oliver and Mary have been very unlucky, haven't they?
I like the color violet.
William is already retired.
I've been arrested before.
Muhammad traveled under an assumed name.
They looked away.
The bus was full of young children.
I don't like studying.
I'm surprised that you didn't know William used to live in Boston.
Charlie's house has a hidden room.
I don't think that that's a factor.
George isn't going to buy a camera.
How does the front door-lock work?
James and Valentina didn't want their pictures taken.
Adam and Carmen told me they knew who did that.
You'll regret this in the morning.
Susie's dress is too short.
Have you gone to places like Boston and Chicago?
You didn't know anyone there, did you?
I think one of us ought to talk to Oscar about this.
Jacob tried to avoid looking at Emma.
I want it done within the hour.
George was Carmen's first dance partner.
She doesn't look like she's lonely.
Did you know Jami wasn't having a good time?
Enough, I said.
If you allow your dog to go free in the park, you will receive a fine.
I know that Harry isn't a close friend of Anna's.
He says he's my friend, but then he totally hung me out to dry in that meeting!
Joe is doing a great job.
I didn't expect to sell my old guitar for so much money.
Almost all these apples are rotten.
I usually eat out.
You don't need to yell. I can hear you just fine.
That's my bike.
Can you help me organize my files before you leave?
Jami only waited a moment.
Margaret is sensible, isn't she?
I don't think that Jacob knows what it's like to be in love.
Jami is just going to need some time.
I don't drink and drive.
I just had my hair done.
It's the way it must be.
I'll pay you back as soon as I get paid.
You don't think that we should do that, do you?
Charlie and Lucy dated for about three months three years ago.
Who made this song popular?
Please stay a little longer.
Catherine said she may do that.
I have some questions I need to ask Adam.
I've met the perfect woman.
I saw him just this morning.
Alex and Susie don't really know how old John is.
I suspect Jack and Catherine went to Boston together.
Jacob and Mary told me they wanted to wait until October to do that.
Did you remember to buy candles?
It's a bunch of nonsense.
Is nobody else coming?
It's the last chance.
Oscar didn't know Margaret spoke French so well.
You've always known this would eventually happen.
George himself helped Mary.
I knew you'd never let him die.
He might not come.
Well, in this country you're not allowed to do that.
I know you from somewhere, don't I?
I just wish Joe didn't need to be alone.
I am looking for an apartment located on the second floor or higher.
Jami has been sleeping in his car.
Harry isn't worried about what might happen.
I don't believe in your religion.
Let's hope we never have to do that.
She said you hit her on the head.
Do we really have to go there?
I know that I can't be replaced.
The work has been almost completed.
I always thought Adam and Catherine would eventually get married.
I don't know if Charlie and Mary are good at chess or not.
They'll be really busy, won't they?
I'm not able to do that alone. You need to help me.
"The phone is ringing." "I'll get it."
Tommy will be back within a week.
I didn't want to go to the dance with Oscar.
I have been studying for two hours.
Could you help us translate this text?
Jacob wondered how many times Eva was going to run around the track.
I am studying again.
The police is coming!
Jacob told me he thought that Emma would be here later.
I'm not blaming you.
He is just passing the blame onto others.
Oliver didn't deserve what happened to him.
What a sad movie it was!
The attorney has strong evidence that she is innocent.
Is there a telephone here?
Oliver knew he should've done that by himself.
I wrote a book about this.
It looks like Jami has missed your cooking.
Of course I'm going to the party.
I wonder why Charlie and Alice don't do that.
Is that what I was saying?
They were unfair with him.
The judge sentenced him to a fine.
I think we need to do that.
It's my turn to walk home.
Alex probably doesn't know that I hate him.
Jacob didn't react fast enough.
I'm always suspicious of men like him.
I don't ever want to go to Boston again.
The pain will go away.
They were quite beside themselves with joy.
I knew we should've tried to help Jack.
I suppose I could have waited longer.
You are my father.
This machine is out of order. Please try again later.
We're a real tight group.
It isn't often that Tommy does that.
The responsibility was in large part mine.
I've heard French is a difficult language to learn.
My laptop crashed.
Where did I park my car?
All I know is that something happened that scared the kids to death.
If and when he arrives I'll pay.
I'd be grateful to you if you did that for me.
Adam and Julia couldn't imagine themselves doing that.
Could you please pass the potatoes?
Alice didn't seem surprised when Joe told her he needed to do that.
Dan won't leave me alone.
It's been ten years since my grandfather died.
Anna is in her seat.
Have you been watching me?
Charlie knows everyone's waiting for him.
I thought you were good at math.
Why do Jacob and Susie hate me?
I don't have any family to support.
I'm sorry you drew the short straw on this.
Where's the remote control for the TV?
Whatever you wish on others, it will come to you as well.
Joe doesn't look angry.
Don't you want to know what I think?
Do you have the time?
He said he can't wait any longer.
There's still a chance that that going to happen.
She threatened to kill him.
She is a young student.
Muhammad and Julia said they didn't know when John was planning to go to Boston.
George said he doesn't think that Valentina really knows how to do that very well.
Muhammad never even tried to kiss me.
Oscar and Julia own the house up the street.
I'm anxious to see what happens.
I'm the one that has to do that.
I'm too old to have children now.
Oliver plans on doing that soon.
What made you ask that?
Carmen is feeling good about herself.
We have a lot of things to do.
That happens to us a lot.
Jacob and Valentina said they wouldn't be able to do that in three hours.
How did you learn French?
If you start at once, you'll arrive by six o'clock.
Harry and Laur told everybody that they'd gotten divorced.
I have other matters on hand.
Please keep on working even when I'm not here.
Someone who knows English well must have written it.
We're going to find a way to do that, I'm sure.
They told me that they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
In our culture, we can't be married to two women at once.
You don't want us to do that anymore, do you?
I was at a movie theater.
Let me explain how this needs to be done.
For all his wealth, he is unhappy.
She is in a mood.
Muhammad does that so much better than Monica can.
Joe is quite good at his job.
That's not what you used to say.
I'll definitely keep my windows and doors locked.
"Father, why are you putting on clean clothes?" "Because I'm going to church."
I think learning French is a lot of fun.
Could you introduce me to a lawyer?
Charlie told his wife he had to work late.
To love our neighbors is our duty.
Jami doesn't understand why Anna got angry with him.
I didn't expect it.
It is as if we, not Brazil, won the game.
Jacob told me he wants to win.
The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.
Adam said Lucy was going to do that for John.
She got him to do everything she wanted him to do.
I asked Anna where she'd gone.
People are getting scared.
How does Muhammad intend to fix this?
Don't swear!
What did George and Carmen name their baby?
Muhammad and Carmen fixed the car all by themselves.
Alex will be moving back to Australia.
They told me they were ready to do that.
You should really tell him.
I love roads.
What do you charge for lessons?
Do you think you can ride that horse?
You'd look pretty stupid if you did that.
Do you want to go to the zoo this afternoon?
I wasn't surprised when Oliver told Monica he didn't need to do that.
Joe told everybody he was retired.
Somebody told me that I shouldn't trust you.
I thought you didn't smoke.
Helen came to Japan last year.
Children are so vulnerable.
They said they weren't jealous.
I cried all morning.
I have a few questions for you.
I wish you success in your work.
I don't think that anyone really thought that Oliver was happy.
You two look like you're in love.
Harry admitted that he'd been naughty.
I don't think James is impressed.
Their hobby is fishing.
I don't think that Charlie really wanted to do that.
We tend to eat more when more food is available.
When she looked, the men were building the way.
Charlie put the card in the wrong way.
They help anybody that asks them.
Who wants to take this home?
You've got to come with me.
Joe knew that Olivia was going to be late.
What I really want to do is to ask Julia for a divorce.
I told you I'm not ready.
If you used the time you spent complaining practicing your basketball, then maybe you would have stopped complaining a long time ago.
James said he won't be in Boston next week.
Nothing's happening down there.
George and Emma are both hoping nothing bad happens.
He is a very good speaker of English.
You don't know how bad I want to see you.
I've heard this story scores of times.
If you make a promise, you should keep it.
I think I've figured out a better way to do that.
I knew that Oscar had already done that.
I saw you spying on him.
I don't want to hear anything more about Harry.
My office is on the third floor.
I know that Alex knows that we don't how to do that.
Didn't you hear me call?
It's absolutely marvelous.
Was Alex asking for a raise?
Laur thinks that she's ready.
Alex and Monica said they needed to get rid of a bunch of stuff.
I can't wait that long.
What am I going to find in here?
We're going to need a little more time.
I'm going to look for Alex now.
Alex is doing a wonderful job here.
I know that Tommy is a bad student.
It is said that he is sick.
She passed out on the floor.
The doctor told Mary that she should try to get more sleep.
I talked to your doctor. He told me that you needed to stay in bed for at least a week.
If that guitar weren't so expensive, I could buy it.
I think George may stay in Australia for another month.
This should be corrected.
How about a play date next Sunday?
"I'll do it tomorrow." "You said that yesterday!"
Tennis, my favorite sport, has brought me a lot of friends.
Jack ended up in Boston.
James doesn't want to get married.
Muhammad and Laur said that they weren't working in Boston anymore.
I know that you're tired.
I definitely won't agree to do that.
Not this time.
I passed by your house about 10 last night.
I didn't know that George wanted to do that again.
May I kiss you goodnight?
Harry never realized what was happening.
Frankly, I didn't have the confidence to ask Anna to have lunch with me.
Harry told me you need help.
Why didn't you try calling me?
I'm not sure James will be able do that.
Muhammad told me that he's cold.
I've decided to fire Harry.
Alex told me he thought Valentina was new.
George thought it would be fun to go sailing.
It's time for lunch.
I hope to have that sort of opportunity again.
I play tennis after school.
Oliver said that he was going to leave tomorrow morning.
I am very pleased with the second part of the video.
I'm sorry I kissed Alice.
Nobody knew where those kids came from, but nobody wanted to receive them for fear of their disease.
Tommy and Olivia are one of the most famous celebrity couples in the world.
There were some who didn't see the joke.
Jacob wanted to sit down.
They live here all by themselves.
I wonder what Oliver will tell us.
William said it was time to start thinking about what we need to buy.
She hates rules.
I don't remember what my grandfather looked like.
Can you blame Harry?
A good doctor follows his own directions.
Carmen said that she wouldn't mind helping us tomorrow.
Why does Charlie hate me?
I doubt that I could help you with that.
I wish Adam would visit more often.
I said he could go.
James had a great weekend.
I'd like to introduce you to my parents.
She has said she should do that.
I was embarrassed when he talked to me.
She will never change her mind.
Eva has already told me she doesn't know how to do that.
I don't want to study in Australia.
I think James is nuts.
Oliver asked if there were any questions.
Jack and Monica say they aren't planning on going.
Jami never had hip problems before.
I'm not good at this sort of thing.
Jacob was a doctor in Australia.
I adopted an orphan.
Jami got up and walked out of the bar.
She said she doesn't plan on going.
I decided not to try anymore.
I'm actually very interested in doing that.
I don't mind if I get wet.
No one is listening to them.
They could do that if they tried.
I wasn't lonely.
I have a mind to buy a new car.
I know that you must have a million questions.
James said that he didn't really care if he won or not.
Why should I give money to you?
We had to learn the lines of the play in park.
We're cousins.
You're already old enough to do that by yourself.
I thought that you'd like James.
I don't like this kind of music.
What're you in such a hurry for?
It could happen here.
It's my job to protect you.
You should keep on until you succeed.
Do you have a sore throat and a headache?
We visited Joe in the hospital.
I haven't used this very much.
Jami has made similar claims.
Harry can do that by himself.
Valentina said she remembers being there.
Let's give Harry his reward.
Emma's hair started turning gray before she turned thirty.
No matter who comes, don't open the door.
I want to sleep!
They were badly off in the village.
I thought that you said that William had to do that.
Jami divided the bread into two pieces.
They've waited for you.
I wish Jacob hadn't seen me doing that.
So do I.
Why do we not go home?
Which subject do you prefer?
I think Oscar's plan will work.
Both Charlie and Valentina like riding horses.
Muhammad could hear his name being called.
How fast was the horse running?
We're looking for someone.
I can't show up looking like I've been working on the farm all day.
I ate my sandwich.
He has a large family to support.
My students are always studying.
How was the year 2013 for Charlie?
Apart from his parents, no one knows him very well.
I had never seen so many in my life.
We're all set.
He as well as you likes baseball.
I wonder why George is so excited.
I wonder if somebody could tell me what I should do.
I promise not to tell them.
We bought a new washing machine.
Just do me one last favor.
We've got a lot of stuff left to do.
I can't think of everything.
Is there a TV in the room?
George isn't sure he can help Carmen.
We knew the potential was there.
I waited for you at the park.
I saw William looking at himself in the mirror.
Alex and Olivia didn't know that I'd be here today.
That ugly man has a beautiful wife.
How do you know what to buy?
Alex doesn't let Alice drive.
I will be very glad to serve you.
Muhammad took Catherine's suitcase by mistake.
I greet you.
Why can't you control yourself?
Catherine Jackson wasn't her real name.
William can see me.
I have nothing to add.
She's honest.
I don't think that Jami is sure that that's what Margaret wants to do.
I knew that Oscar knew why Margaret was doing that.
Oliver should've told me he was married.
If you can't solve this problem, ask your teacher.
Coffee, meat, potatoes, fruit, nuts, cheese, and a book. What more do you need?
With just a little more effort, he would have succeeded.
She has not so much patience as you.
Dan didn't even give Linda a reason.
Catherine told me that she doesn't know what that is.
Don't make me do this the hard way.
Be kind to the children.
We have to consider the problem more carefully.
William ordered some pie and so did Mary.
I did it all alone.
Only a few of my friends can speak French.
You ought to have been more careful.
Choose any one of these books that you like.
I know that you're pretty interested in Tommy.
The workers united to demand higher wages.
There's nothing like a good hot bath.
It was obvious to all that he meant it.
James, would you join us, please?
Joe has got to get ready for dinner.
I know Charlie didn't know that Catherine knew how to do that.
The prince has set out on a long journey.
I had it coming.
I think that Muhammad would be happy to do that.
Charlie and Laur are worried about that.
I have to go alone.
Muhammad deserves to be treated better.
He is not only brave but wise.
I wouldnât go there for all the tea in China!
The coffee he drank was quite expensive.
I was hired.
Tell Muhammad that I'll do it.
We've got to get out of here somehow.
How do Jami and Monica know each other?
A baby rabbit had been caught in a trap.
It's been almost three years since Jack died.
We're all vulnerable.
Where's Harry's card?
Are you going to hurt us?
I'm really very happy.
Joe refused to talk to Julia.
We remind you that our terms are 60 days net.
I'd like to drink a cup of coffee.
They've achieved their goals.
Knock it off, guys.
Jack didn't want the same thing to happen to Catherine.
It's obvious Harry doesn't like doing that.
They just don't trust you.
He told me that he wouldn't wait.
When you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this: you haven't.
Charlie helped Olivia fold the laundry.
I don't think that you need to tell Harry why you want to do that.
The news put an end to our hopes.
This is the town I told you about.
William showed Lucy a wallet-size photo of his son.
Do you dig it?
He turned to the right instead of turning to the left.
Your English doesn't sound ugly.
Alex said that he wanted something hot to drink.
It's not a money issue.
Making babies is not hard labor.
I'd like to do with you but I can't afford the plane fare.
Jacob is losing his mind.
Stop sticking your nose into other people's business.
He's a bit of a rebel.
Oliver wasn't funny either.
Maybe I should come back another time.
I didn't feel like cooking.
They said they didn't want drinks.
Didn't you know that Jack was going to go to Boston with Eva?
Where did this other policeman come from?
You had plenty of opportunity.
We're about to start doing that.
I'm sure you're going to heaven.
My eyes are sore.
I want to know how Tommy did that.
Jack always calls me on my birthday.
Happy people are those who remember only the good things from the past, while unhappy people are those who remember only the opposite.
I found it difficult to get along with him.
My shift's almost done.
They admitted that they didn't cry.
Adam and Alice knew there was nothing they could do to help.
This book belongs to the library.
I make it a rule to take a walk every morning.
I'll only talk to them.
I wonder if Oliver knows that Eva didn't do that.
They said they weren't ready to do that.
It's hot today. The temperature is up to 45Â° C.
She's good in bed.
I don't think Jack knew whether Monica wanted to do that or not.
We would like you to come to our party.
Adam didn't know about the party.
Who do you think you're talking to?
He has a generous nature.
Joe and Catherine said they wished John wouldn't go out after dark by himself.
Which side won?
She bought articles of clothing one after another.
Muhammad told me that he thought Emma was married.
I always naturally hated drinking.
Alice wanted to show Jacob what she'd bought.
As soon as Joe gets here, we can start the meeting.
Do you think they might be dangerous?
Don't waste your time and money.
Please don't go in there.
Adam should be done doing that by now.
They decided to shut down the factory.
Many years have passed since then.
Jami is in love with Anna's younger sister.
He's working in his office.
Susie is coming home soon, isn't she?
I would like to go and get my stuff.
Jami said Emma wasn't at school last Monday.
They have things they need to do.
I might need that.
Jami and Lucy said they didn't have any plans for next weekend.
Muhammad told me he thought that Olivia was dead.
You're supposed to be listening.
I got sick last weekend.
He spoke to me about it.
What if it's too late?
Oscar said he wasn't in Boston at that time.
I'm going to Australia next week with some of my friends.
You're one of them too, aren't you?!
The butler opened the door.
I don't eat meat, but Charlie does.
This chair is very comfortable, but I don't like the color.
Joe followed Emma out of the room.
Monica realized that she wasn't as smart as the other kids.
William doesn't like to be disturbed.
Freedom is a new faith, the faith of our time.
Catherine nearly got herself killed.
I don't think it's such a big problem.
Catherine said she wasn't likely to do that.
I've been walking to work recently.
Please answer me when I speak to you.
I just let Harry do his own thing.
Lucy said that she's hungry.
So what's your point?
The chances are that the bill will be rejected.
He's useless.
The honor you are giving me is more than I deserve.
Wait for your sister.
I heard William speaking to Anna.
Do you have any idea why someone would want to kill Jacob?
Harry and Lucy said that they were very frustrated.
I'm being fired.
My grandfather lived a long life.
What you said is not true.
Charlie isn't really planning on doing that, is he?
I had a hard time leaving.
William denied taking drugs.
You need to buy them presents.
We eat bread.
Jami has a little girl named Emma.
I'm not sure that I can be all that much help.
I'd like to know why Jami wasn't there.
I wonder if we're done.
Alex never asked me to do that.
I thought Alex was going to like it here.
He needs something to drink.
He is in an angry mood.
We're taking care of it.
I would very much appreciate receiving a copy of the book.
That is a very interesting story.
Everybody was so wonderful.
If you know where James lives, tell me.
I can't see who Jacob and Laur are talking to.
Why have you never said anything about this before?
Muhammad said that his father worked in Australia.
I'm sick of eating at the same place every day.
My pen is very easy to write.
She said she felt alone.
George wants me to buy him a pony.
They never said they weren't married.
Harry told me he didn't know how to do that.
Charlie is likely to still be jealous.
As far housing goes, it is very poor in Japan.
They don't miss a thing, do they?
This bag isn't big enough.
Have they found Tommy yet?
Joe says that Valentina thinks she can win.
Will you tell me how long you have loved him?
Joe told me that he knows Margaret.
No one could tell where she was.
Joe and Monica don't like John. However, he doesn't particularly care whether they like him or not.
I think Harry can do that better than Julia can.
When I was in Australia, I visited Jacob.
Have you ever been late for class?
Gas has been found below the sea.
Carmen said she needed to do that as soon as possible.
They said you wouldn't let them in.
There's a bus stop there.
I have to solve this problem.
How much is an apple?
I don't see why we can't talk.
Adam said that he didn't want to sit with Monica.
Why don't I just talk to her?
I just want you to know that I'm sorry.
I need a moment with you.
The CEO raised his salary even though the company was losing money.
I know that Jami didn't know who did that for him.
Don't you want me to tell you why?
Did Oscar know that you were planning to do that?
Alex looked around to see if anyone was watching.
Muhammad wanted to spend some time in the country.
This was very difficult.
Bush won all the wars he fought.
Jack should get started.
I wish I hadn't told Jack that I was going to do that.
Jacob is selfish, isn't he?
Muhammad and Julia probably thought they were going to have to do that today.
I've made the same mistake myself.
No one wanted to talk about it.
If Lucy could speak French, I'd hire her right away.
I doubt Charlie will be fired for doing that.
I've done this several times before.
I don't think Oscar knows that Mary needs to do that.
George said he hoped he'd be able to buy what he needed for $300.
It doesn't seem serious.
George doubts Emma will keep her promise.
William said he thought that I might not need to do that.
Why do you need money?
Do you really love them?
Um...am I mistaken in some way?
It's just another day.
Oscar almost always does that alone.
Harry and Laur told me that they weren't sleepy yet.
Harry and Laur let me know that they wouldn't do that.
Oliver is the only one who ever really knew me.
They are struggling to survive in business.
Did James tell you what his plans are?
Muhammad thought Monica was scared.
You can keep it if you want.
Jack and Julia both said they thought it probably wouldn't snow.
I wonder what your plans are.
We have problems that need to be dealt with.
Carmen said she wished you wouldn't do that anymore.
I didn't need to go to Boston.
By the time our long conversation was over, Mother was tired of standing.
You have to go to sleep.
Adam promised he wouldn't tell Susie.
He removed his helmet.
I suspect George won't wait for me.
Harry is downstairs, too.
I think we don't need to do this anymore.
Get your socks on fast. We're late!
If it weren't for the sun, life would be impossible.
Sometimes too much to drink is barely enough.
Oscar told his friends that he never ate meat.
Singing is her strong point.
I'm efficient.
I'm tired of hearing you call Jami an idiot.
The news that he had succeeded delighted them.
Carmen only speaks German now.
Boston is the place to be, right?
George is in grave danger.
Jack and Laur told me that they don't know what they have to do.
It's not as though the world is going to end if she leaves.
Harry died in combat.
Why are Harry and Julia home?
The aircraft was so fast that I couldn't even see it.
Please do that once more.
James, Susie and a few other people went yesterday.
Now, what do you want me to do?
Why he got angry is quite clear.
Your parents ought to know it.
That gives one a horse laugh.
I told Oliver he should drink more milk.
They won't catch me.
William and Susie can make themselves understood in French.
I helped an old man cross the road.
I speak French every day at work.
I feel so excited.
Tommy passed out because of the heat.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Harry any money.
Whatever may happen, I am prepared for it.
You didn't really think Joe would let me do that, did you?
Jacob thinks that I'm an idiot.
I told Charlie a few jokes.
The man who is standing there is my father.
The pool is full.
You know how stubborn she can be.
My birthday is in July.
What are you afraid of, when there is nothing to fear?
Oliver and Susie looked into each other's eyes.
I was sleeping while James and Alice were doing that.
I knew William wasn't yet finished doing that.
Here. This is for you.
Jami says he wants to win.
Why does everybody love cats?
I don't think we're getting anywhere.
They said they were afraid to go there.
It doesn't matter to me if Muhammad comes or not.
Jacob said that it's not over.
I thought you said that you wanted to go swimming with us.
You can wait in this room.
Joe and Lucy said that they want to join our band.
The law isn't always fair.
You are the next in line for promotion.
Olivia knew she'd have to do that.
I think it's too soon to judge.
She's already done her homework.
Catherine is very tired, and she's hungry.
My past self is another person.
Valentina was certain that she'd recognize Jami when she saw him.
Alex is full of confidence again.
My life hasn't been the same since I met her.
You eat like you're still in college.
Jack said that Margaret was going to do that on her own.
I don't like being retired.
She told me that she'd been sick.
Adam knows that Anna doesn't always do that.
Take your time when you eat meals.
We chose a good present for each of their children.
It's not over.
I have just had one of the worst days of my life.
Please tell us a story.
I'm not feeling relaxed.
George admitted that he did what Olivia asked him not to do.
You kids must be tired.
This is an important point.
Oscar warned Alice what would happen if she did that.
Is this a pen or a pencil?
George says he can't ignore the noise any longer.
Muhammad retired in 2013.
Charlie especially likes going to Italian restaurants.
I'm eating breakfast.
Her father is a famous doctor.
Is he into me?
Do I smell bacon?
Tommy heard the guard approaching.
Where did you knock them down?
They're reading in their rooms.
Can't you see he doesn't want to talk to you?
Can I get by the guard?
Jack will probably be a good roommate.
I just want to make sure that doesn't happen again.
I was about to go out when he called on me.
I didn't think Jami would be alone.
I thought Jacob said he was planning to do that.
No matter what you do, somebody won't like it.
Which is your stronger language?
How long can it be kept going with 100 dollars?
Follow your desire.
We talked with the owner of the house.
Do Jami and Anna really want to be left alone?
I think that Oscar felt a bit threatened.
We have a lot to talk about right now.
I think I'll cry.
Joe can swim a lot better than me.
Can you recommend me a good camera?
He's been looking for a job for months.
I didn't think that Harry was being unfair.
I wonder whether Alex thinks Anna has to do that.
Tommy ran as fast as he could hoping that he wouldn't miss the train.
The house was more expensive than I had expected.
I didn't know that you owned a truck.
I left early so as not to be late.
Knock, knock. Who's there?
I wish I knew why.
Oscar is never going to suspect a thing.
Why is Jack trying to talk to Carmen?
The next station is where you get off.
The system is working very well now.
Adam admitted that he agreed to do that.
It was not long before he was appointed professor.
I don't have to worry about money.
Emma had nothing to say, so she left.
I know that Joe is the one who's supposed to tell Eva that she shouldn't do that.
Harry could have taken the money.
We won't have a problem.
"Is the weed on the show real?" "Well, what do you think?"
Olivia warned us.
James doesn't think Emma will do that for John.
You look tired today.
Who did you receive that book from?
I'm a volunteer.
I'm still not finished.
Joe and I haven't eaten yet.
This apple is too small.
I would have told you before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
It is certain that he missed the train.
Jack burned the letter.
I haven't yet filed a formal complaint.
We must be healthy.
William and I go camping together every summer.
William and Carmen told John that they didn't like his sense of humor.
Look at the house with the red roof.
I've got a job in Boston.
James is getting married in October.
Joe was completely taken by surprise.
Tommy will never complain.
I'm sure Alex will get around to doing that sooner or later.
There are no girls on the Internet.
I doubt very seriously that William will be early.
How did you know that William was dealing drugs?
I'm suffering from a broken heart.
I have to fight.
"You can't have fun all the time." "Why not?"
Oliver has at least three children.
Why is she talking to me?
What are you after?
Jacob isn't dangerous, but Lucy is.
James heard that Julia and John had split up.
James told Monica to go next door and see if the neighbors needed any help.
The police is searching for an escaped prisoner.
Muhammad is still looking.
How often do you go to the zoo?
I always wondered what that noise was.
I heard Jack can sing really well.
A man can know the price of everything and the value of nothing.
Didn't you know that I used to live in Boston?
You promised me you'd take care of them.
Jami and Julia said they were too busy to help John do that.
We'll meet up with them later.
I don't understand people who eat breakfast for dinner.
Charlie doesn't think Catherine is mad.
Laur says she's not planning on going anymore.
Your father is a good-looking man.
I just saw it for myself.
George told Monica to enjoy her day off.
It isn't going to be long.
I don't want charity.
Mary said she didn't know Oliver very well.
I'm worried about Tommy's life.
Valentina lost her key.
Jack and I both kept quiet.
That's mine. Give it back.
Do you think this book is worth reading?
I'll help you, but I don't think Alex will.
We'll do our best to work as quickly as possible.
He is running ahead of me.
Oliver is only a teenager.
Just stay here.
I think I could learn a lot from you.
You think that I'm just talking nonsense, don't you?
Olivia seemed to be happy, didn't she?
They never listen when I talk to them.
Olivia would do anything to get what she thinks she needs.
Carmen told me she wasn't sleepy.
You said you didn't want to go.
She went to school by car.
They often talk to themselves.
Joe hasn't accomplished anything so far.
I told you before that I'm not interested in hanging out with you.
They can barely feed their families.
I couldn't talk to Alex.
This restaurant is open 24/7.
Tommy seemed nice.
Jacob loves money.
I'm going to tell Muhammad and Alice what I really think of them.
She started taking off her shoes.
That girl at the bar gave you a fake phone number, didn't she?
I tried to go back to sleep, but the noise kept me awake.
The boat was clean.
Harry is a friendly kid, isn't he?
Harry was dead set against the idea.
We're coming to your assistance.
Jami went abroad soon after he graduated from college.
I don't think I'm the person that you're looking for.
I wish I hadn't lied to the police.
He never made a display of his learning.
I will give you a ring every night.
She said she found something strange.
It's more dangerous than it looks.
Some people think Mary was poisoned.
I don't have enough experience yet.
I hope that I don't disappoint you.
There's hardly any chance Oscar will win the election.
You may have to help him.
I'm pretty excited.
James didn't have to go to the hospital.
Because the Japanese morning train is very crowded, I would be out of breath if I caught the express train at 8 in the morning.
I took Oscar in my car.
Let's try not to lose each other in this fog.
Oscar can wait for me here.
Jacob and Monica were walking towards the station when I saw them.
Joe said that he thought Lucy wasn't happy.
Don't make this harder on yourselves.
Do you remember where he left his umbrella?
Jack died during his stay in Boston.
Oliver asked me to leave.
Oscar doesn't want to buy another car.
Ask Margaret what she wants to eat.
Mother comes to stay with us at least once a month.
Neither George nor Carmen has anything better to do.
The dog looked into the water.
I feel like I have to be there.
Adam has learned.
William doesn't like riding his motorcycle in the rain.
You look very sleepy.
She plans to break up with her boyfriend.
Alex refused to show me where he found it.
I thought you said you wanted to be the last one to do that.
I'd like to study this topic in more detail.
You never seem to want to help.
Go and see what Jack is doing upstairs.
We've got a good life.
I didn't think Jami would mind showing you how to do that.
Margaret isn't really sick. She's just pretending to be sick.
I thought you'd like it.
Tommy needs to see a doctor.
I'll lend you one if you wish.
I need to be ready by 2:30.
She knows guns.
All my efforts were in vain.
Here comes Tommy! Act as if you were busy!
George tried to help Mary up the steps.
William is very generous with his money.
You should tell her how you feel.
We must stay perfectly calm.
I miss you. I really want to see you.
James plans to start doing that as soon as he can.
I don't eat as much fruit as I should.
Jacob has never hurt anyone.
I think I have a cold.
He chose the wrong man to pick a fight with.
You will speak Swedish.
I want to become a boy, no matter how hard it is.
Charlie kept still.
We have to wash the clothes.
What really happened to you?
Let's do the work.
Trains were arriving on time.
I think I should just leave.
How much are you going to charge us?
You mustn't be late.
Jacob left work at 2:30.
Actually, we have sort of a problem.
I know Jacob won't want to dance.
I was told that I don't have to do that.
Adam and Mary aren't tired, but John is.
I think you should find out when William and Valentina plan to leave.
I do not go to school.
I never said that he was a saint.
The actor came out from behind the curtain.
When all was said and done, the world was not destroyed on December 21, 2012.
Harry is smarter than any other student in his class.
Let's follow his advice.
The boys are all the same age.
I don't know where your house is.
Did Alex really agree to do that?
Oscar doesn't have as much experience as I do.
Never forget it.
Adam is still too young to drink beer.
Let's all take off our shoes.
Today was a very tough day.
It's the animal in me that wants it.
Tommy lay face down on the blanket.
Share it with us.
I don't think that James will come.
Time passes by so slowly.
Why didn't you invite Adam to your wedding?
Mary says she's not planning to stay here all winter.
Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself.
What's your goal?
Jacob will have to do that somewhere else.
Do you really think that Tommy likes Monica?
I'm crazy about American football.
What will it take to get you to vote for me?
I have two sons and two daughters.
Muhammad does it very well.
I will do anything you say!
I didn't leave early.
Luckily, I was able to talk Charlie out of doing that.
Harry asked Eva to close the window.
How about studying together in the library?
I'm not thirsty.
I have no idea what death is like.
Mary could hear Oliver, but he couldn't see her.
Between us, he is a little foolish.
I'd appreciate it if you would turn off the lights.
I suspected that Oscar didn't really want to go to Australia.
I missed the train by only a few minutes.
Adam and Mary raised three children.
Today was such a bad day.
Julia wasn't born yesterday.
James hasn't done that, but heÂ ought to.
Why can't I have a phone when all of my friends have one?
I came to surprise her.
Jami isn't any stronger than me.
George and Laur claimed that they didn't do that.
Charlie and Mary knew they needed help.
He told me that he's done.
Is Cookie a dog or a cat?
Harry and I used to go shopping together.
We can understand everything she's saying.
The roses smell nice.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
Tell me exactly what you'd like me to do for you.
I don't think that you need to tell Adam anything about what happened.
Harry said doing that would be a good idea.
We're just getting ready to leave.
They did not invite me to their wedding.
He is always up and doing.
There is a library in our city.
I sold my house in Boston.
I wonder if George is busy now.
It looks nice.
Russian is very difficult to learn.
It could not be otherwise.
Jack is drinking some coffee.
George has my vote.
You don't have a key, do you?
Can you tell me what it is?
You are a fabulous woman.
I like this dress. It's kind of cute.
William told everyone he'd decided to do that.
The explanation was beyond my understanding.
He is in the habit of taking a walk before breakfast.
It won't be worth the risk.
I seem to be lost.
George and Anna live in the apartment above John and Alice.
I expect William will be back soon.
They said that they're determined to do that.
I suspect that Jami and Anna are scared.
I don't think that Jack would try to kill us.
My Internet connection is slow.
As a matter of fact, he knows very little of the matter.
The sound took me by surprise.
What is she dancing to?
They mean trouble.
William didn't seem to have any trouble doing that.
This was a great gift for her.
It looks like it'll be clearing up.
This rich man is greedy.
Doing that is healthy exercise.
I thought that you said that you were willing to do that.
Would you like some of my food?
We were lucky to win that one.
Alex said he'd do that for us if we asked him to.
I treat you to a cup of coffee.
We'll get there in time.
I know that Alex didn't know that I was going to do that.
You're eating like you haven't eaten anything all day.
They can't eat it all themselves.
They're watching over us.
That's not why Muhammad didn't do that.
The helicopter landed on the roof.
Joe told me his job was a lot of fun.
What we need is a good plan.
The suit becomes him.
Was William a teacher?
I'm still young.
Why on earth did you take him to the station?
Alex will make a good spy.
Can you tell me what's wrong?
It's really up to you.
I'm just kidding.
She fell fast asleep over a study aid.
We're never going to make it.
Why are you crying? It's just a movie.
I wonder whether I really have to do that.
I knew that something strange might happen.
One of the books is in French, and the other is in German.
James doesn't look like John.
What's your favorite love song?
The coach is leaving soon.
Oliver is the only one wearing a suit.
It wasn't that expensive.
Jacob said that Alice told him she'd never met John.
Could you tell me where I can park my car?
You may borrow this book as long as you keep it clean.
I don't regret it one bit.
I may teach French in Australia next year.
I thought the dress Catherine was wearing looked really nice.
This looks like a great place.
Bill will win, won't he?
I know Tommy isn't a very creative person.
I counted up to 200.
Maria never married.
I had a really great time tonight.
Lucy didn't want anyone to see her.
Jack is a miller.
If Harry gives you any trouble, just call me.
Alex doesn't like being treated like a child.
I need to exercise more.
Why are you in the hospital?
Oscar might want to walk home with you.
He didn't really mean that, did he?
Jack is likely going to be in Boston next Monday.
Take no chances.
Charlie doesn't seem very tired.
She was born in a small village.
George moved to Boston quite a few years ago.
Alex said he hoped he'd be able to help us today.
People need to eat.
I don't think I can walk any faster.
Tommy can't tell if Valentina is serious or not.
The moment she'd finished, she lay down for a nap.
Do you know, how high is the television tower?
There's nobody here.
There are no longer any problems in business life, there are only challenges. And challenges are opportunities. So it is no problem at all if the company is in the red, it's just another opportunity!
This is genuine Kutani-ware. I guarantee it.
Charlie and Olivia say they don't know where John lives.
They should have contacted us.
You're a loser.
It's very dirty.
I think Alex is pulling your leg.
I came to talk about her.
I'd like to take a look outside.
I assume that Adam will eventually be arrested for what he did.
What brings you here tonight?
I am as tall as he.
Do you like liver?
Her mother started screaming.
If he tried hard, he would succeed.
Oliver is pathetic.
She's still a minor.
Jacob can't make me do it.
James said he was unlikely do that.
I want to go and see Jacob.
George Harrison was a gentleman all his life!
He was cool about it.
I'm fairly certain Jami and Catherine don't know how to speak French.
I sweat a lot.
Monica loves what she does.
She accused him of stealing her car.
I don't get to Boston as often as I'd like.
I knew Tommy was the one who was supposed to tell Catherine not to do that.
Monica said she likes swimming with Charlie.
I'm really going to miss them.
That's just life.
They fell and hurt themselves.
I'm going to go check on her.
Tommy pulled off his shoes.
I regret that I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
He admitted that he'd been rude.
Her house stands back from the road.
I put this question to him.
James told me he was doing that now.
Dan asked Linda to take all of her clothes off.
What is this bird called?
I think Oscar is the only one who can't do that.
Let Anna eat whatever she wants.
We're having some problem.
Oliver began singing.
You should lock your door.
I'm one of the three guys who were able to do that.
I wouldn't miss that for anything.
I was very confused by his questions.
Oliver's friends called him Money Bags.
I'm in love, but I don't know if it's mutual.
William has decided that he isn't going to try to keep Alice from doing that.
The police arrested him for drinking and driving.
If I'm not too busy, I'll help you tomorrow.
So, what do you recommend?
This company and I have signed a contract of three years.
Oh no! I forgot my camera.
How far away is your school?
He is a rich but dull man.
I don't think I'd like Boston.
I slept lying on my face.
Are you still sure it was Alex?
How often is Jami late for school?
It makes me feel young again.
William sat there for a moment without saying anything, and then he got up and left the room.
I didn't read any of these books.
It's all my fault.
I told Jacob I would help them.
I hid myself in the closet.
Oscar walked into the kitchen holding a small box.
I really don't understand French.
I'm not in Australia.
What's this song about?
Alex is studying in the college library.
What did I say?
I can't go back to the way it was.
Something very bad happened last Monday.
Adam said he was concerned about the problem.
Did you buy what I asked you to buy?
I have what I need.
Can all of your children speak French?
I warned Lucy, but she didn't listen.
"How do you know the day?" "My father wrote to me himself."
I've been with the CIA since 2003.
My uncle gave me his car.
Aren't you going to come to Jack's party tonight?
I built it myself.
Alice was frightened of her strict mother.
Jacob and I have a lot of fun together.
Catherine said James wasn't as angry as she thought he'd be.
It's strange that our friends aren't here.
Have you ordered the book?
It took Jacob three hours to get to Boston.
Can he write this character?
Tommy and Lucy won't be able to do that without your help.
Jacob has no idea where Laur does that.
I'm going to need your phone number and address.
Are you certain that Charlie and Eva can take care of themselves?
I was a French major in college.
They said that they didn't have any money.
You don't seem to be as tired as James seems to be.
What a big cat!
I must get a bad tooth pulled out.
Harry was the leader of a gang.
I didn't know that Tommy knew who did that for you.
I wonder whether or not Adam is alone.
Take it away.
Have you said anything to Jami?
Jack would have wanted to go to Boston with you.
Walk faster so as not to fall behind.
They said they'd think about it.
He called his son James.
There was an abandoned car by the river.
Adam said that he wants to win.
Anna looks very pretty today.
Emma knew that Jacob loved her.
Harry must make his own decisions.
Tell Muhammad thanks but no thanks.
Come back immediately.
We were just about to leave.
Do you know all the letters?
Oliver went for a walk in the park.
Tommy asked Lucy who her French teacher was.
You must eat properly to keep up your strength.
Love has ended.
Adam returned the compliment.
She's very upset.
Jami almost agreed to do that.
I know that Alex is a friend of a friend of Catherine's.
Where is she?
I didn't think James would be the first one to do that.
Jacob is just three weeks older than Mary.
Oscar doesn't know why Catherine is mad at him.
Jack considered changing his job.
What more could we possibly do?
Alice said she would've done that by herself if she could've.
It's all about having fun.
I hate to remember the day I was busted.
You will recover from your weakness soon.
Why can't we just take a cab?
She was the youngest of three children.
Get on your horse.
He said that he would write to us.
She does all the cooking.
I have no future.
I plan to live here for the rest of my life.
I speak French with my parents.
I think there's a good possibility that that will happen.
That was worst thing William could've said.
I didn't think that Oliver wanted to go to Boston with Valentina.
I knew that Joe wouldn't enjoy doing that with me.
I didn't want to go to Australia without William.
I woke up just after 2:30.
Joe is a fine young man.
I wish we'd get some news.
William is going to be heading back to Boston after lunch.
"You're a lucky man." "I know I am."
Please give me all these.
Nobody was satisfied.
I don't have enough time to get the job done.
You can't deny that Joe is charming.
Love is not important.
Muhammad and Laur don't think they're going to do that.
Tommy said that he thought I might be allowed to do that.
We always get a lot of visitors this time of year.
Have you ever been to a foreign country?
I'm doing this because I have to.
I want to take a plane back to Boston.
Keep your hands on the wheel.
Alex is terrified to see the vampire standing at his door.
She didn't say who she'd gone with.
I was playing soccer today.
Do you like being with me?
That club is way too big.
Alex told Laur that he wasn't going to go to Boston with us.
I can't die here.
The reality keeps changing.
I wanted my children to learn French.
The band is excellent.
Such thing can't be true.
They didn't want to sell their car.
I think I'm going to be arrested.
This project still keeps me very busy.
Jack assumed everyone knew Eva couldn't understand French.
I know that Oliver has to leave tomorrow.
Alex needs a prescription.
Can I hide in here?
I hope we don't get into trouble.
I said I wasn't serious.
I gave her a blanket.
Are you going back to work?
Oh, seriously?
I don't really want to eat with Joe.
I don't have to pay rent.
This is the first time in a while that someone we had such high hopes for came to our department.
Who'll succeed?
Although marriage is a great thing, don't worry; what should be yours will be yours.
Susie knew that Oliver was mad at her.
I thought that Harry was angry.
Adam makes everyone nervous.
He tried to keep dry as best he could.
I don't have anything to do now.
I thought you were going to travel around Australia.
Why didn't somebody help him?
I didn't hear a word of what Muhammad said.
Lucy didn't do what we asked her to do.
Has anyone found them yet?
Get your things.
I don't think Muhammad is confident.
The atmosphere in Washington became very tense.
The children are safe.
I'm pretty sure that's it.
While I was talking over the telephone she came to see me.
I'm sure Jack wouldn't be ready if Laur hadn't helped him.
Mary listened to her grandmother's stories.
She said she's been feeling sick.
Charlie doesn't mind doing that.
Are we all happy?
Alex got special treatment.
That's okay.
Do I have to open the window?
The letter is inside the envelope.
We're dizzy.
They want to know about him.
How do you get downtown from here?
George showed his garden to me.
I'm sorry that you should think that way.
We must go to the bank to exchange some money.
We're not saying Jack is wrong.
Alex and Lucy are expected back in Boston on Monday.
I talked to William last week.
They're not as nice as they used to be.
I don't mind if the weather is hot.
James says Olivia doesn't believe John did that by himself.
Tommy just kept driving.
I saw James three weeks ago.
James said Laur thought John might need to do that this evening.
Jacob is getting off the plane right now.
It was a strange affair.
I can't fix this computer.
Alex and Eva have similar goals.
A trust fund has been set up for each of the children.
No one speaks that language anymore.
I feel pretty comfortable here.
Muhammad will eventually learn to do that.
They went in opposite directions.
Tommy hired a new secretary.
If you've got something to say, go ahead and say it.
They have wine.
I was struck by lightning.
Sorry for keeping it secret from you.
I didn't know I'd be first.
I'd love that.
I asked him if he would go too.
Jami is an open book.
Catherine told Muhammad she'd teach him French.
You're not wrong about that.
I would have done it by myself if James hadn't been there.
Jacob arrived the day before I did.
I appreciate your help on this.
They can produce those goods/merchandise for much cheaper.
Charlie and Valentina aren't being very helpful, are they?
We did that earlier this month.
I need to go get my laptop.
No one is more determined than I am.
Please ask Tommy to be quiet.
Joe said Catherine wasn't at home when he went to visit her.
Tommy can find the time to do that.
Adam often eats breakfast with us.
James doesn't want to deal with it.
I've been waiting so long for this.
I spent several months in Boston last year.
The nearest star is about four and half light-years away from the earth.
Alex won't ask you to speak French.
Alex is going to prison for the rest of his life.
I wish everybody liked me.
Wait in the lobby.
I sometimes watch TV.
They told me they often dreams in French.
Alex woke up at midnight.
Jack told me that he wouldn't ever do that again.
Alex thinks I'm an idiot.
I think Joe really deserves it.
Let's look at each step in more detail.
Could you get me some tea?
Harry and Carmen thought they'd be able to win.
Jack told everybody that Lucy was there.
You do know how to drive, don't you?
Will you let Alex and Valentina do that?
I didn't think James looked nervous.
There were many who couldn't recognize him in that disguise.
We're safe now.
Adam and Lucy said they'd like to visit Boston.
James and Laur say that they have no plan to do that.
I haven't quite finished eating.
Dogs like playing with other dogs.
Only love can break your heart.
I'll show that to him.
Let me think about it a bit longer.
Jack never got better.
I'm sure Harry will work it out.
God exists, but he forgot the password.
What you say does not bear on our problem.
Tommy speaks French better than he speaks English.
I should go now.
William has been my best friend for as long as I can remember.
She asked him if she could go home.
I made supper.
You really deserve it.
I think that Charlie doesn't win very often when he plays chess.
There is something in my eye.
I don't believe Jack actually did his homework by himself.
We'll be back in three months.
You're happy, what have you been doing all this long time until now?
She couldn't handle it anymore.
What was taken?
Laur said she told you.
It's yet to be determined.
Muhammad promised me he'd clean his room.
I didn't think James would be so sweet.
Man was not born but made man.
You can't see Adam anymore.
"What's wrong with you, Maria?" "I don't know."
I hope Jami and Anna are finished doing that by 2:30.
She's not very good at it.
Go with the flow.
I'm still not used to getting up so early.
George has much more free time than Mary.
Alex shot himself with his father's gun and died.
We knew one day it would happen.
James and Susie said they left early because they were feeling sick.
I'm eating dinner now. Can I call you later?
When did you change your address?
What did you do with that book?
We don't have any food in the house.
I wish to speak with you in private. Call me.
I think that Oscar could help.
Harry and Mary aren't as thin as they used to be.
How much does an egg cost?
Tell me what movies you guys have seen.
I'm pretty sure that George is from Australia.
Harry said he planned to stay until next Monday.
I don't think that Jami can handle the truth.
It'll take at least an hour to get there.
A bird flew into the tree.
I don't recognize any of these names.
Charlie says he hopes that you don't win.
I asked my father to bring me to the circus.
I have spoken with the Polish ambassador.
Adam and Margaret say that they aren't coming.
The meeting began at nine o'clock sharp.
He didn't even look over the papers.
I want to travel by airplane.
She brings the party with her wherever she goes.
It's often said you should judge people by the company they keep.
It occurred to me that my watch might be broken.
I'm good at anything I set my mind to.
Alex has known Catherine for close to ten years.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tommy didn't know what to tell Julia.
Jami said he needed to do that by himself.
I know that George will agree to do that.
You need money to make money.
George spent the whole day listening to music.
Let's see if you've learned anything.
I don't like her.
Harry's willing to help us.
It's now my turn.
I'll give you a hint.
I think Oliver didn't know what to do.
I don't know anything about her family.
Did you like this book?
Let me see the pictures that you took in Australia.
I don't want to get divorced.
I didn't think James would have the time to do that.
Alice wants to do that, but she doesn't know how.
Everyone was more or less interested in the arts.
I took part in the discussion.
You've lost weight, haven't you?
I knew that Charlie could do that if he tried.
That was the time when he came.
The Police caught him red handed.
Tommy should do that if he wants to.
What are we supposed to do?
And that is where the difference lies.
James said doing that was harder than he expected.
Everybody was interested in the story.
We're doing all we can.
I'm fairly good at doing that.
Jacob suggested we do that.
I don't live with my parents anymore.
George is here to meet Monica.
Why don't you read the manual?
Why are you surprised?
Alex and Laur got there early and they got really good seats.
You really didn't want to do that, did you?
George has decided he's not going to buy one.
Alice says she's thinking about not doing that.
I don't plan on getting caught.
This film is very interesting.
I don't think George will be scared.
Would Muhammad ever consider doing that?
He is a lucky lad.
This is really sick.
Muhammad didn't have time to react.
He told me I was pretty.
I know that I haven't lived the model life.
George asked us if we'd like to go to Boston with Anna.
We should try to help them.
Father often says: "Time is money!"
Adam and Eva are uncomfortable.
Muhammad didn't tell me why he wanted me to do that.
Living in Japan is very expensive.
I was coughing.
I suspect that Harry and Mary are going to hate this.
I have a nice pair of shoes that are too small for me. Would you like them?
He is reading books.
They said that they're innocent.
What can Charlie do that Catherine can't do?
You won't do any better.
I saw his pictures in Japan.
Adam says he doesn't have to do that right away.
Jami thinks I am his enemy.
His behavior really got on my nerves.
Oliver may not know that we're here.
I just sat there trying not to think about how alone I felt.
James said he would do it again.
Oscar is visiting Anna in Australia.
Can you tell me the way to the library?
Where was this book published?
I still think that we should've gone to Australia with Jami.
She said that she would come back.
I don't know whether William and Carmen are telling the truth or not.
I'm afraid Alex might agree to do that.
I had him in that discussion.
I don't know what she did, but it worked.
I asked Jami and Laur what they'd do.
I admit that I've never actually been to Australia.
He prepared dinner by himself.
Oscar needed somebody he could trust.
I met a young man whose name was William.
She has seven sons.
She's not even a teacher.
They can do that wherever they choose.
I never got an answer from him.
This is gonna be wild!
I'm not busy.
James never got an award.
It didn't make me sad.
Let me show you how I do that.
Joe promised himself he'd never do that again.
George said that he would buy what was needed.
George does that better than Mary does.
This is a real fine evening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks?
Emma is going to do as much as she can.
Jami and Julia said that they loved baseball.
Muhammad is efficient, isn't he?
Why is Alex lying down on the table?
I don't think he can help you.
Jack started calling Carmen names.
Harry could've been offended.
Monica said she isn't sure Oliver can swim.
I didn't think Joe would show me how to do that.
My sister is very intelligent.
Eva will do what she has to do.
That's a splendid idea.
Jack and Mary didn't have their phones with them, so they couldn't call John to tell him they'd be late.
I shouldn't have written that.
Hey, I'm not a doctor.
Tommy says he's feeling OK.
Are there any other choices?
We can't afford to eat at a restaurant.
We won't swim.
Where did you get that water?
Harry is quite strong.
Take our picture.
I thought that I'd always be alone.
I'll stay close.
Joe is serious about his work.
It is my son.
It depends on how much money you have available.
They said that they didn't know French.
I do hope you understand.
I bought this at the train station.
We all die sooner or later.
I'm going to be back in Boston tomorrow night.
There's something happening on the other side of the river.
I want you to do it at once.
George learned a new word.
Jacob is used to these sorts of situations.
I wonder why women survive for men.
Jami wants me to do this now.
Jacob is scheduled to be executed.
I think you're going to make it.
Charlie and Emma don't plan on doing that until I tell them to.
I didn't know what to do when that happened.
Do James and Julia always do what you ask them to do?
She loves you very much.
I was on the phone.
Tomorrow is my birthday.
They sell meat in this store.
Muhammad is the one who started the rumor.
Maybe he forgot.
A new pope has been elected.
This price is reasonable.
I saw a house with a red roof.
Please lock the safe.
Let's go to that new restaurant on Park Street tonight.
I gather that they'll agree with us.
We hope that Oliver hasn't been seriously hurt.
Margaret says she won't be able to do that today.
How did you get to know she was ill?
I suspect Oscar has to go to Boston next month.
Nobody seems interested in dancing with me.
James wasn't ready to jump.
I already knew that Jami wasn't planning to do that.
Quit following them.
Help me, please.
Everything was about to change.
I asked Alex to tell me why he didn't do that.
I've been learning a lot about them lately.
After spending three weeks looking for a job, he found a well-paid one.
This would look so cute on you!
I know exactly what I should do.
The garden has a wooden fence.
Joe told me that he didn't take French in high school.
I knew that Charlie was supposed to be doing that.
Please tell me that's not a bomb.
I have more experience than James.
George told me he thought Carmen would be early.
Do you think about us a lot?
James doesn't have a key to the closet.
Did Charlie go to the station to see Lucy off?
I found a tree frog on the wall in my bathroom.
The horse is white.
He is still green at the job.
My ears feel like they're stuffed up.
Your time's up.
That's about right.
To be badly off makes life hard to bear.
Do you think I should tell James?
I can speak for myself.
Looking out of the window, I saw a man standing near the door.
We're getting tired of them.
She has a double-barrelled name.
George has already been told he isn't going to be allowed to do that.
Mom, George ate my cookie.
I met Jacob decades ago.
I didn't think that Alex could do that.
My mother was a dancer.
I'm going to need your help doing this.
How do you decide what's right for you?
I know how that goes.
James was in the house.
Thank you all for that.
Tell me about it now.
First words get confused, then ideas get confused, and finally things themselves get confused.
Muhammad wondered who won.
Jami didn't want to leave.
She told me that she saw that movie.
Everything will be decided on Monday.
Perhaps Alex could talk Monica into doing that.
James told Lucy that she should be the last one to do that.
I have a date.
Both Jack and I don't understand French at all.
My money is my money.
I won't give you my sandwich.
He studies very hard.
How did Jack know Anna knew French?
Tommy admitted that he'd killed Olivia.
He seems to have had a great amount of money.
Joe is the captain of the team.
Does the school have a library?
You haven't told Muhammad why I have to do that, have you?
I agree with some of your opinions.
Though he is clever, he isn't wise.
My native language is not the language of my mother.
We waste a lot of time.
Muhammad said he knew the reason why Valentina did that.
She stood waiting for me for a long time.
George suggested that we don't watch this movie.
Alex said he's not making much money.
I thought that you'd be busy helping James.
It's very healthy.
William proposed to Carmen in a Chinese restaurant.
Would you be able to write down the link to the site?
Oliver really should do that.
He is very stubborn.
Did you have any trouble finding this place?
This isn't a bad thing.
Oscar and Monica told me that you were with them yesterday afternoon.
The question is where to buy the book.
Harry will be there three days.
I know why James left Australia.
Could you give me a better price?
I figured you'd probably never want to see me again.
What are Harry and Laur going to think?
It's mean to do that.
That just might happen.
William told me that he thought Alice was rich.
He didn't want to speak about her anymore.
Harry pulled out a book and started reading it.
William felt trapped.
Oscar didn't seem to be afraid.
It sounds easy, but it's not.
Oscar hasn't yet told me who helped him do that.
Everything depends on it.
It looks like you've lost some weight.
That wasn't there before.
We'll meet again some other day.
I'll graduate next year.
I want you to go to Australia with George.
I can't use that.
We aren't too concerned.
Adam isn't going to try to do that.
That just doesn't make any sense.
I think Oliver has spent time in prison.
James told me he was finished doing that.
I switched off my computer.
Carmen said that she was very sick.
I've decided not to go to college.
The police took the criminal away to the police station.
Please don't touch Charlie.
I told Oliver to ask Mary.
They all look the same to me.
Harry said that he thought I might not want to do that.
The child cried loudly.
You hold my fate in your hands.
Smoking, please.
If this ever happens again, I'll probably get fired.
Charlie has been really upset.
Maybe Jami is trying to tell me something.
I'm not fooling around.
Alex needs our guidance.
I know Jami isn't a very good dancer.
Oliver had a son.
I heard that William has married a rich widow.
If he's late, it's OK to start the meeting without him.
How can you concentrate?
I don't think we have much time.
Oscar put on some climbing boots.
The change of air had done me much good.
Eva has been here all her life.
Being right is not always what is important.
There's no need to worry about me.
Monday will be a hot day.
Will you do that tomorrow?
I can tell you that it didn't happen.
You can't be serious.
I think Jack and Valentina did exactly what they said they did.
You guys seem to be having a good time.
That might not be Jami.
I've got business with Tommy.
I asked Adam if he really wanted to do that today.
Where's your friend?
Without his glasses, he is as blind as a bat.
Alex owes what he is today to his wife.
I'll tell Olivia we're going with her.
What's Jacob worried about?
You're wealthy.
You didn't recognize me, did you?
There's no time to worry about that now.
Oliver said he'd prefer to stay at home.
He's tired after his German lesson.
Oscar was born there.
What love!
We'll have to have a little discussion regarding that last point.
The baby was taken care of by its grandmother.
I learn as much as you do.
George isn't wearing his uniform.
Joe is ready for anything.
I don't think it's a very good idea.
I regret what happened here yesterday as much as you do.
Joe is likely to still be OK.
I'm a bit anxious.
Joe is our older son.
I've done a lot of horrible things.
How long will it be to dinner?
Alex did that because he was ordered to.
I told Jack why Catherine had never graduated from high school.
This was not the deal.
They looked like they were dead.
The general public can't attend.
I never was shy.
He did not make his position clear.
How can people do that?
Jack said that he wasn't very worried.
I don't think that I'll be able to get in there with Jacob.
I was caught in shower on my way home.
Oscar and Alice are in the next room.
It would be fun.
My grandfather says he's too old to swim.
No one knew William and Anna were there.
I thought that it was an important decision.
Harry is going to ask Valentina if she can help us tomorrow.
I wonder how many people in Australia can speak French.
Jack is going to meet you there.
I was fond of cake.
I'll fix a drink.
William and Eva are out of the woods now.
I can't breathe.
Do you think William wants to do that?
I thought that you had a driver's license.
He did what we told him to do.
I'm going to do that, too.
James says that someday he'll be able to do that.
I think that Harry might leave for Boston early tomorrow morning.
I like seeing you this way.
Who invited you to the party?
Tell Oscar that he should go back to Australia.
This is the only thing I care about.
We lock the door at night.
Tommy was shot in the neck.
Give me a full glass of water.
Today was fun.
We did it as a team.
You're going in the wrong direction, aren't you?
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
Valentina wouldn't have sung if we hadn't asked her to.
I love my town.
I don't know what Tommy watches nowadays.
When are you getting married?
You never seemed to enjoy doing that.
The road is free.
Charlie doesn't live in Boston yet.
He asked the men, "Would you share a room?" "Certainly, we will," answered the three men.
I got up at 2 in the morning.
I can't imagine that that's changed.
I'll try to never be late again.
Oscar kissed his children goodnight.
Does Catherine really think William is younger than she is?
All this is simple and easy to understand.
William was trapped in the cave for three days.
Take this!
I doubt very seriously Joe will need to do that.
I hit Muhammad.
There's a very good chance Jami will be here tomorrow.
Jacob and Susie say they try to do that once a week.
I'll see you whenever it suits you.
Jami and Catherine keep to themselves.
I know that Harry won't be doing that with Margaret.
William wasn't allowed to speak French.
Alex and Julia said they understands our concern.
I almost got run over by a truck.
Here, try some.
I don't think that this is enough food to feed all of us.
I think it's Oliver.
Oliver and Margaret know how to take care of themselves.
Have you told her I'm here?
I would have told you this before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
Alex told me he had a plan.
You must help me save us.
Ask Tommy about it when he gets here.
William is waiting for Susie in front of the station.
Jami might be in his room.
You needn't have seen him to the door.
I beat Jacob.
I had a lovely time.
If you've finished your homework, you can go outside and play.
Oscar doesn't want to own a restaurant.
Let's see what Tommy can do.
I'd like another beer.
Did you know that Oscar spent time in prison?
Out of the mouth comes evil.
I don't know how much more I can stand.
This is no time to be shy.
I have nothing to do with that crime.
I was waiting for James to do that.
Who's the author?
I think that Jacob is fine.
I won't tell you where I keep my money.
I told him not to tell anyone.
I never liked them.
I think William is the one who's supposed to tell Laur she needs to do that.
All life is an experiment.
I hate fighting.
Charlie is in a state of shock.
Adam asked Margaret if she wanted to go to a movie.
This shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
We should call Jami.
Where does Adam usually hang out?
I thought you said Harry was leaving.
I don't think we're going to make it.
What was the name of the hotel where you stayed in Boston last year?
William held out his hands.
Drop in on me in Paris one of these days.
Does Harry still feel that way?
I knew that Joe was afraid of his grandfather.
When is William coming back?
Bad things are behind me.
I promise you that I'll do that.
I wonder whether Muhammad is really planning to quit his job.
We put all our old furniture in the shed behind our house.
Please tell Charlie he doesn't have to do that.
The car started to pick up speed.
Don't come unless I tell you to.
William doesn't like being alone.
Monica collapsed in tears.
I think that Charlie isn't sure that's what he needs to do.
I don't think that Joe knows when Margaret will leave Australia.
I like the mountains around here a lot, and come often for vacation.
She told me she won't marry me.
My family are all very well.
Jami and Lucy say that they needed to do that.
Indeed, I keep the closet closed.
They say they should wait.
George sometimes puts honey in his tea.
I don't know much about horse racing.
Everybody laughed at Jack.
I haven't slept in two days.
What impressed Joe the most?
That's where the heart of the case is.
I hope this comes off easily.
William doesn't do that kind of thing anymore.
She doesn't want to speak, being afraid of making mistakes.
You need a bath.
What kind of books did you buy?
I know they talk about it.
Don't bother me about that.
There was nothing I could do about that.
I thought that you should read these documents.
I knew you'd do what we asked.
They soon realized they were trapped.
You're like a broken record.
He lost the key to his hotel room.
You sound like an old man.
James sold his car to Alice for three hundred dollars.
That must be fun.
There's a possibility that'll happen.
Joe is going to lend a hand as well.
I told Jacob what Mary had to do.
Oscar deserved to be happy.
If anyone else did these things, their political career would be finished.
Tommy thought Alice didn't drive a car.
Charlie said he hopes that Julia won't be late.
She is as beautiful as her mother is.
Neither Harry nor Catherine has gone fishing recently.
Please let me do that for you.
The office has been transferred up to the sixth floor.
I know Harry is almost always busy.
Do you want me to bring you some water?
Are there movies in an airplane?
Have you met the new girl?
He's three years older than her.
This sentence is true.
He's always been living in Tokyo.
Most people here don't understand French.
Charlie isn't there.
Aren't you on the team?
Eva was just happy to talk to someone.
Lying is second nature to him.
William didn't need to leave in such a hurry.
Tell William.
I spoke to Jack about what Anna did.
Tommy said that he wouldn't let it happen again.
She said she wouldn't be gone long.
Oscar's death was ruled a suicide.
Do you think that James will likely win?
You should tell Jacob you won't do that.
Don't trust what he says.
I know I'm dying.
I don't like it when Harry stays out late at night.
He told me that his house was haunted.
I'm looking for a new hobby.
I spoke with Tommy after class.
Oliver often tells people I'm his wife.
George forgot the address.
Harry seemed to be very suspicious.
Charlie didn't have enough time to answer all the questions on the test.
Muhammad was planning on killing someone.
I know that William didn't do that right.
I can't survive here alone.
Did you know that was happening?
William doesn't drink wine.
Put the book on the bottom shelf.
Jack has been taught to do that.
My knees feel like butter.
That was a big surprise, wasn't it?
He said he was worried.
Why were you in such a hurry?
William and Monica had no choice but to ask John to help them.
Have him wait a moment.
He does well considering that he has no experience.
Jami and Monica are arguing about something.
Put away your wallet.
I want to give you these.
That's the same way we do that.
Don't kill me, please.
No one informed me of his failure.
Harry has been doing the same job for many years.
Alex and Catherine are already rich enough to buy anything they want.
Here's a photograph of Jami.
I know I can't do that as well as you can.
I'm surprised that Muhammad turned down such a good offer.
Look out your window.
I thought that George wasn't in Australia.
I doubt that Tommy will admit that he was wrong.
He came near to being run over.
Don't ask me that.
Lucy says that she didn't win.
I like to hit Jami on the head.
Jacob has never seen Eva naked.
Muhammad said Carmen would win and she did.
He is busy all the time.
Harry and Laur don't know that John doesn't like them.
Look up at the sky.
She is looking for a job where she can make use of her foreign language ability.
I'm not skinny.
I didn't know I needed to do that with George.
Tommy said Carmen is fine.
We'll have breakfast at eight o'clock.
I don't know how noodles are made.
Oscar isn't married to the same woman he was married to that last time I met him.
Having heard the story before, she didn't want to hear it again.
Do Oscar and Alice still have it?
"I need to talk to you. It's urgent." "Tell me, I'm listening."
Have you told everyone when the meeting will be?
Does he still have a temperature?
This is a love song.
Have you figured out the math problem yet?
Do you have any idea how many hours Tommy will do that?
Are you ready to celebrate?
Ask him whether she is at home or not.
Harry said that's just not true.
Did Facebook play a major role in the Arab Spring?
If he did not watch so much television, he would have more time for study.
William hates you.
I need to do that before Oliver and Julia get here.
It's hard to get along with Dan.
He carried out all his promises.
Maybe we should've listened to George.
Keep it up, guys.
Neither Jami nor Laur has been teaching very long.
Jami said it would be OK to do this.
It's just around the corner.
He's already finished his lunch.
Muhammad will always love you.
I asked Carmen for her keys.
What's Joe so curious about?
Oscar and Olivia are better off without you.
I plan to go to Boston the month after next.
You're probably upset with me.
I never had to worry about Oscar.
Would you please show some regard for others?
There's a rock in my shoe.
I'm not saying this to hurt you, but it's the truth.
Let's quit talking about this.
Would you guys just shut up already?
Jacob doesn't think he'll do that.
What else is on today's agenda?
Muhammad seems angry.
Jacob is working at the new restaurant on Park Street.
Jami left half an hour ago.
Oscar wasn't sure what to think.
I thought that the best thing would be to tell James myself.
Like most problems, this will eventually be solved, I think.
I'm very tired today, so I went to bed earlier.
I like to write songs in French.
Eva looks like she's in a lot of pain.
Catherine didn't tell anyone what she was planning to do.
I thought Jacob and Emma weren't hungry.
Harry will be too scared to do that.
It may not have been as difficult to do that as Tommy said it was.
George said that he wished that he hadn't suggested to Alice that she do that.
She bought a shirt for him.
Are you Alice's husband?
There are all kinds of flowers in that garden.
Jacob and Lucy said they aren't making a lot of money.
Eva told me that she thought Charlie could probably do that.
I did that the way you suggested.
Both Adam and Emma are very worried.
Maybe Oscar is afraid to fight.
Joe thought that Carmen looked nervous doing that.
I have to go see what James wants.
Margaret wants me to coach her.
I know everything about it.
Don't tell tales out of school.
"Why are you throwing books in the fire?" "Because I'm cold."
Do tell me what he said.
The police found drugs in Alex's house.
Julia didn't want to make a fool of herself.
I just need to see Charlie.
Neither Jami nor Monica want to go to Australia.
While staying in Paris, I happened to meet him.
There's no sign of them.
Harry is down with the flu.
Oscar is scared of me.
Anna didn't seem very sure of herself.
Oliver hates to admit he's a member of the older generation.
I didn't arrive until the party was over.
William and Valentina told me they enjoyed it.
They should be here soon.
Alex and I know why you did that.
I'm not as young as you think I am.
I wasn't prepared for what happened.
George just got a tattoo.
A man with a big bank account can't be ugly at all.
Catherine is in love, isn't she?
When can we get together?
The fire burnt ten houses down.
Oliver hardly believed his eyes.
I don't think I need to worry about Joe anymore.
He threatened to kill himself.
You could still do that in a nicer way.
I thought I had it all.
He saw his home-town again only after ten years.
The concert was incredible.
Lucy told me she wanted a lawyer.
What's your favorite radio station?
I've already told Oliver and Eva they have to leave early.
Every time I read this novel, I find it very interesting.
Are you learning German?
I think James and Valentina have both done that.
What am I supposed to do if Muhammad and Margaret come?
George and I sat on the ground.
Bring her home.
Tommy is going back to Boston soon.
Consider me your friend.
I loved Boston.
I'll come visit you tomorrow.
There's a possibility that I'll be the one who has to do that.
Muhammad has already been here once today.
Muhammad works for the FBI.
Can you spare me a few minutes of your valuable time?
Wow, you totally look like an artist.
There is no topic I am more passionate about than this one.
They're a lot like I was at their age.
The battery is flat.
I'm very well indeed, thank you.
You're my lovely little baby.
I think I'll throw some of my old clothes away.
Oscar and Anna told me that they'd help us.
They say they'll go there by themselves.
James asked us to wait.
Harry told us that we could buy a ticket at the door.
Tommy is the only person who really knows what happened.
Where do you buy your clothes?
The driver is OK.
We don't want to talk about it.
He has a split personality.
A guard is outside.
Susie won't likely try to do that on her own.
Charlie knows that Valentina didn't cry.
He was passing by on his bicycle when he heard a cry for help.
I go to see my friend in hospital every other day.
Charlie will leave the company at the end of the year.
She told me she was glad to see me.
You don't look too surprised.
James doesn't seem to trust anyone.
It looks like Oliver wants to go to bed.
You may rise.
Indeed she is not beautiful, but she is good-natured.
I had to stop Tommy.
You'll never guess what Alex bought.
I took one class, but I've found that real-life experience is much more useful.
I told Alex you'd probably enjoy doing that.
There was no one inside the house.
That isn't a dog.
You seem tense.
It's super easy!
"What about the girls, my son?" "Oh, dad."
Are you sure he can do this?
He has spoken Spanish.
George told me Susie has been living in Boston for three years.
Why are you angry with me?
How hard would that be?
Adam said he'd do anything for Lucy.
These are the shoes I bought last week.
I saw that report.
Are you and Jack both baseball fans?
George knows why Monica agreed to do that.
Kiss me, Jami.
I thought that's what you would have wanted.
We weren't tired at all.
Oliver has found an interesting way to make money.
I wish none of this ever happened.
This key doesn't work in this lock.
Joe made a wrong turn.
Does Alex have any brothers and sisters?
I didn't want to do what George told me to do.
Unlike you, I don't make fun of people in public.
Can any of you tell me where Tommy is?
Alex told everyone that he was suspicious.
Margaret is a baseball fan, isn't she?
We can't leave them behind.
She is a good teacher, as teachers go.
Harry likes to watch sports on TV.
I'm going to have to cancel my appointment.
I'm sort of in a hurry.
I can't call him.
Jacob doesn't think Catherine will be alone.
Harry would be furious if he knew.
I am quite in agreement with your analysis.
Dig faster.
Tommy doesn't like listening to sports on the radio.
You'll look into it for us, won't you?
Alex doesn't seem to be an easy-going person.
We did everything for the welfare of our children.
I'd like to know why George should do that.
Do you still have a house in Boston?
You should've kissed Jami.
You're avoiding me, aren't you?
I thought that it might be fun, so I went to Jack's party.
She counted her change.
Carmen doesn't want to call her lawyer.
Jacob told me that he didn't get enough sleep.
I know how to swim, but I don't like to.
Julia said that she knew how to win.
Australia is sure a great place to live.
I don't think Jami would let you drive his car.
Life gets really simple once you cut out all the bullshit they teach you in school.
James and Eva took out their cameras.
Oliver is heading our way.
There's no fire.
Drop by sometime!
Catherine told me that she was very busy.
Oscar tried to hide the truth.
Lucy told me that she knew you.
I think I can explain what's going on.
I didn't think that we'd need to ask Harry to help us do that.
Joe isn't actually going to eat that, is he?
Adam says he plans on being in Australia next weekend.
Never mind that right now.
I don't think Oliver is going to do that tomorrow.
Harry says he thinks that isn't going to happen.
Adam called this morning.
Please show me the path to the bus stop.
Wild animals live in the forest.
That was difficult at first.
What have they done to her?
I'll show you how it works.
Let's sing some English songs together.
Oscar did exactly what I told him to do.
They didn't want me to sit by them.
Charlie and Julia said that the box was too heavy to lift by themselves.
Jacob has lost both his job and his house.
The mountains look nicer from a distance.
I've got a lot on my mind.
Who runs things here?
He made a close analysis of the situation.
You can't change Jack.
Oliver and Olivia wished they hadn't asked John to teach them how to do that.
I knew Jacob was in the kitchen, cooking.
Adam and Olivia's marriage only lasted three months.
I wonder if Joe is frightened.
Go see him.
George will buy Valentina that.
Tommy and Olivia have finally realized that they've been doing that the wrong way.
I wonder whether Joe does that as well as Emma does.
That won't ever happen.
Does that make a difference?
Let's delay this decision until tomorrow.
Jacob runs as fast as you.
Oliver didn't know it was impossible, so he tried doing it.
Joe and Mary said they didn't see anyone else.
How long will that be?
I was never good at math.
Muhammad showed us a picture of his girlfriend.
You look as if it were none of your business.
She gave me something.
George has nothing to complain about.
"That's an unusual hobby she's got, the transfer student." "She's cute so it's fine with me."
The Japanese yen rose.
I wasn't cooking anything.
Is that really what you want to ask?
You shouldn't let George push you around.
We'll have to build a pen for the pigs.
You hope George won't do that, don't you?
You should let Adam know you want to drive.
I'm the office manager of a small law firm.
James wore an embarrassing costume.
I'm sure Muhammad will be safe.
If at least two people are great, then no one is the only great person.
I've heard the French version of this song.
I think it might rain tonight.
Susie can't cook as well as her mother.
We didn't plan this.
How is it that he solved the problem?
It's quite likely that Tommy will be late.
Oliver won't likely be better at doing that than Valentina is.
Do you remember what Tommy looked like before the plastic surgery?
Where is the waiter?
I told George what should be done.
James told me that he thought that Susie didn't want to go to Boston.
You didn't ruin your clothing.
This book is worth reading over and over again.
Please tell Olivia that she doesn't need to do that.
I wish that I didn't have to do that.
I think anything James can do, I can do.
What kind of treatment did Alex receive?
I don't hang out with her.
She taught me how to swim.
We can do nothing but wait for a while until the seats are available.
They accepted that.
I met a woman who knows us.
You'll never guess who I ran into in town today.
I didn't notice what time it was that William left.
Every day I learn something new about the world around me.
Muhammad is desperate to find Anna.
Now, the situation is out of hand.
Everybody has problems with Harry.
He didn't explain it at all.
I can't stop here.
This is turning out to be a long evening.
Zip it! Not another word!
He needs to leave.
I never actually studied French.
Well, that's what Charlie said.
I somehow understand your feelings.
I got excited.
That's exactly what it means!
I can testify to that.
We really need to do that.
Save your breath, Jami.
There's a possibility that Jack will be busy all day tomorrow.
They're on their way.
It was real.
I have two cars.
Adam wasn't in Boston, but Emma was.
Is James planning on doing that today?
Alex probably doesn't know much about sports.
George and Laur said they're really glad they didn't do that.
I never want to go back to Australia again.
Get me another lawyer.
I wonder who drew this.
Eva promised that she'd wait for us.
We will have a math class tomorrow.
Let's stay together. It'll be safer that way.
There is no way of knowing where he is.
You should come over this evening for dinner.
In order to share it, we'll have to tear it into two pieces.
Oscar did that eventually.
I finally escaped.
Take your coat.
William won't lose.
I might tell you everything.
How long will you be staying?
They said they didn't like beer.
Why did you go there without me?
I'm surprised that she did such a thing.
My niece is the daughter of my sister.
I don't think James is good-looking, but he's a nice guy.
Why are Harry and Monica downstairs?
I threw the paper into the flames.
Wake Valentina up.
Oscar and Anna planned to go by themselves.
The milk tasted sour.
I'm painting Easter eggs.
How much of this did you drink?
I must put my ideas together before I take up my pen.
You can be anything you want to be when you grow up.
I'm sorry I had to cancel our date.
Tommy said that Valentina was in Boston.
Are they afraid of something?
Hold it.
"Do you love me?" "I don't know."
He said he'd clean up this mess.
You don't listen to me.
Where did Muhammad run off to?
"You don't get on well with your father?" "..." "Sorry, that was none of my business."
He is getting along with his neighborhood.
I got on the bus and the driver closed the door.
Only then did I realize what he meant.
Tommy likes to speak French.
James thinks Laur is worried.
I thought that you knew me better than that.
Jami is furious, but Mary isn't.
I'll check on that right away.
My sister can play the piano better than I can.
You've been very mean to Joe.
I didn't ask you to do that.
I didn't know Adam told Laur he wasn't going to do that.
Carmen and her sister took turns at looking after their sick mother.
Maybe I should have done this sooner.
I leave for Australia tomorrow afternoon.
I think that William was offended.
If you don't want George and Laur here, ask them to leave.
You're famous now.
Let's organize a search party.
It is three o'clock right now.
You've got company.
George couldn't bear to look at the dog he'd just run over with his car.
This is hilarious.
George recognized Laur's glasses.
Alex and Catherine promised me they'd help me clean my room.
My son-in-law works at an insurance company.
James said he'd definitely do that.
Jacob said that isn't the only reason he wanted to do that.
Joe wondered whether he should let Eva go or not.
William and Eva agreed to meet in the lobby.
I don't want to play.
I do not want to drink your tea.
Adam says he's thinking about becoming a cook.
I can't even.
Alex may have to do that again.
Beware of the double standards.
I need to get myself a good lawyer.
Drive slowly.
Do we have to tell him?
I want to give William something special.
My bike was stolen.
I'm surprised Charlie didn't show up at Mary's party.
Harry is someone I really look up to.
There seem to be several reasons for his failure.
Tommy is trying to figure out a way to do that.
I assume that you've had breakfast.
Stop acting.
Did anybody call you?
Jacob should be curious.
We need to get a blood sample.
He's in the hospital.
I don't care about the price.
Valentina is a college student, isn't she?
Tell Alex that I'm going to do that today.
To tell the truth, I've forgotten his name.
I bet Jami forgot.
I was stupid enough to believe Alex.
I knew you were going to say that.
Charlie was starting to feel desperate.
There's some more in the cooler.
I thought that that was very interesting.
James didn't want to tell Emma anything.
The baby did nothing but cry.
I'm not going to say that.
"Listen to me! Listen!" "I have. Now sit down and don't open your filthy mouth again."
Olivia said that she'd pay the bill.
I looked at the clock on the wall.
You might be in danger.
Adam surprised us all when he got up to sing.
Mary says she did not mean to kill him.
The police asked the criminal to give up his gun.
William said he isn't sure that Valentina can do that.
Oliver sat in the car, watching people walking by.
Who was the man who did that yesterday?
I want to write a book.
It is strange that you should fail.
They said that they should've done that.
I thought that you said that you're tried doing that three times.
He was so ill, the doctor gave up on him.
George knows that Catherine went to Australia.
Oscar was sophisticated.
Those who keeps early hour will live long.
I'm getting used to eating alone.
There wasn't a German teacher in our village school.
I should've stayed in school.
I'm hungry. What about you?
I couldn't buy it.
I have to tell her.
This is my favorite restaurant in Boston.
But for the storm, I would have arrived earlier.
What was your favorite toy when you were a child?
Both of them seem suspicious.
I've seen the movie twice from start to finish.
Unfortunately, Jami is already engaged.
William pressed one of the buttons.
That doesn't make good television.
It tastes good.
Why don't you let Adam know you don't want to do that?
If Jack isn't going to go, I won't either.
Is this your first visit to Australia?
You should consider not doing that anymore.
I don't want to get a dog.
You're still very beautiful.
They exhausted all the resources of the country.
She suggested that we go to the theater.
Charlie let Mary kiss him.
How did you come up with the idea?
Please speak French.
William isn't fit to be a teacher.
I've already taken the garbage out.
Joe didn't think you were going to be able to do that.
I'm Adam's younger brother.
Mary had to think for herself.
George would've done that if Julia hadn't.
It must be really bad.
I'm calling from Boston.
Harry knows everything Eva is saying is true.
What time do you walk the dog?
I hope I don't need to do that today.
You can still get that finished before 2:30.
Press and wait for green.
She read a story to her.
You knew Valentina said she wouldn't do that, didn't you?
I want you to work for me.
Oscar gave me a dozen cookies in a plastic bag.
Muhammad wasn't one of us.
Look up the number in the telephone book.
I like to give gifts.
This restaurant won't do.
I knew that I might not need to do that anymore.
It took three hours to put the broken toy together.
I hope not.
It seems that everyone's having fun.
I admitted that I didn't do what I promised to do.
Did you know that Joe would be here this week?
We did not know what fish to catch first.
I thought that I'd get some sleep.
I want this more than anything in the world.
If Jami and Mary had more money, they'd do that.
I hate sweets.
This will give you a rough idea.
When did he arrive here?
I need to speak to them now.
Lucy told me that she'd be back.
I thought that Jack would agree.
It's a wonderful opportunity.
I'll keep it.
She tries to keep up with what is going on in the world.
We had a lot of problems yesterday.
Are you willing to do that?
This door is locked from the inside.
Charlie didn't slow down.
They said they're ready for the test.
I don't want to deal with what happened.
Our teacher seemed surprised.
I'll stay until something happens.
Aren't you glad that Jacob did that?
William didn't want these.
I don't see Jacob a whole lot.
I don't think I'll ever meet him.
Joe said he had something important to do this afternoon.
Catherine doesn't feel we're helping her enough.
I know that William is a little like his father.
She should apologize.
She's your friend.
Which of your parents do you take after in character?
Happiness is real only when shared.
She has hundreds of books.
She's pleased at his success.
George won't find anybody who'll help him do that.
No taking photos.
We probably should've gone to Joe's party.
No one but me is allowed to do that!
Catherine said she'd play tennis with us.
I can drive myself.
Jami is a lot shorter than I am.
Make it a little bigger.
Oliver is a pastor.
Oliver is probably still jealous.
That sounds good!
I know that Adam is a good detective.
Charlie and Carmen are determined to find out why that happened.
He was in tears.
They claim they've done that.
Jacob said he thought that Emma's punishment was appropriate.
When did Oscar return from Boston?
Does it look bad?
How did you and your wife meet?
Jack would never try to do that by himself.
She went to Europe via America.
Lucy got fired from her job.
I'm glad Jacob didn't lie.
Harry thought Olivia had eaten breakfast.
Call him if the message is important.
I beg for your forgiveness.
He says that he studies French.
William grew up in the same orphanage as Carmen did.
They said they had to split.
Muhammad said that Carmen hasn't been punished for doing that.
Olivia is a terrible driver, isn't she?
Charlie doesn't want you to do that.
I think Joe used to be a soldier.
How long will you be in Korea?
That's true for every day but one.
He didn't come to the last meeting.
You'll suffer because of that.
I thought it was a mistake to tell Jami where we buried the treasure.
She said that she liked it.
We'll bring her.
You think James won't really do that, don't you?
I don't think I can cut in working in America.
They told me they found their keys.
Such was her anger that she was lost for words.
Can I have your cellphone number?
I think James and Laur aren't the first ones to do that.
Muhammad says he'd never kiss Carmen.
I was asked to look into the matter.
I'm not used to this cold weather.
I could be in Boston next Monday if you need me there.
If you want Valentina's help, you'll have to ask her for it.
William reminds me of someone I used to know.
What fruit do you like the best?
I was told that you know Charlie's telephone number.
James was afraid Lucy wouldn't notice him.
She said she wanted a new car.
How long did it take Charlie to do that?
We've all got to start somewhere.
Sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you.
She shot her.
I will trust you with one secret.
Alex was so positive.
Don't worry. I'll be back in time to help you get ready for your party.
I hope I never have to go back to Boston.
Joe is likely to be arrested.
They said that they got back home on Monday.
What has Muhammad been up to?
I just can't believe you're planning to go to Boston with George.
I do that because I have to.
Can I trust you?
It's his first day at school.
There's only one way Muhammad will ever do that.
Jack seemed to know that method.
George said Olivia could speak French.
Catherine said she could help us today.
I'm beginning to see that it's going to be impossible.
Jacob makes more money than I do.
Anna has psychic powers.
Do you promise me that you'll do that?
William doesn't even live in Boston anymore.
I've never heard of such a strange story.
I can't 100% guarantee that I'll do that.
Do you know what I want?
I didn't think you had any other choice.
This is simply a lie!
You will love your neighbour as you love yourself.
Did Harry show you anything else?
She was listening to music.
Charlie said he was really glad Olivia was able do that.
He was wearing his new hat.
I thought Alex was jealous.
Make sure you wash your hands well.
"What are you laughing at?" "Your face."
There must be another way out.
I want to sleep a little bit.
I've had my share of problems.
I would be happy to be of any service to you.
How nice of you to come!
George is a cold-hearted murderer.
She worked at the cost of her health.
Olivia looked like she was shocked.
I'm not going to worry about it.
I hope I don't die in a car accident.
She says she wants to help us.
I'm taking Muhammad to the park.
I've had this for years.
He told me I was cute.
I wonder whether Muhammad is really supposed to do that.
Muhammad took one look at the teacher's face and he knew he was in trouble.
Joe and Valentina claim they weren't the ones who did that.
We're starving.
I came here to see if there was something I could do to help, but there doesn't seem to be anything for me to do.
I think Oliver and Lucy have done that at least one time.
George and Mary aren't that poor.
I'll never forget the day we first met.
Do you have something in mind?
Jami's cat is fighting with Julia's cat.
I was waiting.
Farmers work hard in the winter, too.
I promise I won't tell anyone where it is.
He says he won't do that for you.
She is nothing to him.
Alex said that he thought that it would be a big mistake to tell Margaret what had happened.
Margaret should start her own company.
I watched TV only to waste an hour.
Women love lies, men love lying.
I thought Charlie didn't know how to do that.
Charlie and I are still studying French.
It's bigger than any other dog in this town.
I think that Jack is feeling a little stressed.
The school supplies the students with books.
Jack is making a success of his business.
I have three hundred dollars in cash.
Eva is on the swim team.
Emma is a little young for you, isn't she?
I know that I'm in big trouble now.
Jami definitely would've liked you.
Alice has already told Jack what she wants to do.
Could you give me some change for this ten dollar bill?
That's sweet of you.
Let us also hear the other side.
That child has a very large head.
She is very exact in her job.
It's raining where Oscar and Emma are.
I said Tommy looked tired.
Adam waited for Laur, but she didn't come.
I knew you'd be able to do that.
Japanese cars sell well overseas.
I should've listened to George's advice.
Do you want a drink or not?
It's high time to get a motorcycle.
To do him justice, he is not a bad man.
Muhammad asked me if I was happy or not.
I'm working on another project now.
To learn the answer you must know a little about the magnetic field around the world.
We're the only ones here who know French.
I hate running.
She told me that she won't do that.
They fell asleep wrapped up in each other's arms.
He sold his old car to me.
Susie cut her finger.
Alex is still not here, is he?
Doing that here is illegal.
I couldn't just drive off and leave you.
Alex is old enough to do that on his own, I think.
To this point, I've been unable to find a map of the region.
We have something very important that we need to discuss.
How do you think you'll be affected by the budget?
You're a lot shorter than Muhammad and Catherine are.
He said he'd try doing that.
William said that he thought Anna was a good cook.
I wish I had a car like Harry's.
Tommy and I aren't going to do that.
I promised to give her this.
Why did George tear the letter into pieces?
You must make room for the television.
My uncle lives in Germany.
Did you threaten them?
On the back of the truck one can read the warning "Keep your distance."
He is the right man for the job.
It would have been better if you hadn't said that.
James said that he doesn't think that Valentina can stop John from doing that.
She felt herself being lifted up.
Please don't do that unless I tell you to.
William and Carmen said they didn't know how to solve the problem.
I didn't learn how to do that until I was thirty.
I just read a really good book.
I'm not saying that we can't win. I'm just saying it's not likely.
They admitted they cried.
Why is this door open?
The teacher came in late.
George picked up his guitar and headed for the stage.
That would be hard.
I can't see you anymore.
Olivia is still on the team, isn't she?
I'm not thinking about it.
George and Carmen said that they couldn't sleep at all last night.
Jacob has indeed found something.
The light in Oliver's room is on.
Take another picture.
I spent the rest of the night beside her.
He'll be taking an exam next week.
Joe told me that he got there first.
Shouldn't that count for something?
I told James who Julia went to Australia with.
I knew Oscar was the one who was supposed to show Anna how to do that.
It's a big universe.
His wealth got him into the club.
I didn't deny that I was the one who did that.
We're not the enemy.
What kind of a person are you?
I didn't think Jami would make a very good husband.
How do you know it's not a trap?
Joe and Valentina say they spoke French last week.
I want everything to go back to normal.
Stop right there, I said.
I've been in Boston since Monday morning.
He decided to have the operation.
I was shocked to see that.
He wants me to approach it with care.
Jami treats me like a princess.
She said she never agreed to do that.
What's the real reason?
We must've taken the wrong road.
Every challenge is an opportunity.
I'm sending you $12 on my order No. 2345 by check.
There's a traffic jam on the highway.
It's already too late for that.
James looks thoughtful.
Mary said that she wanted revenge.
Tell me your names.
Tommy has been suffering a lot.
We can't let ourselves to be fooled.
Be good to yourself.
I'm coming to you.
Do you like to fish?
Emma said she thought she was the only one who needed to do that.
Jack isn't buying a word of it.
Adam hopes Olivia knows she shouldn't do what John is asking her to do.
James and Carmen are currently living in Boston.
I don't expect that to happen anytime soon.
Jacob said that he knew that they might not let him do that at school.
They knew that they could win.
Oliver said that Margaret is worried about John.
I don't know whether to go away or to stay where I am.
No one will know this song!
I have to get something of mine.
I wouldn't ever really do that where I live.
Charlie used to come here once a month.
I'll go to bed before 10 pm.
I tried to avoid him as much as possible.
What else can William and Anna do?
I've got to see her.
Jim is crazy about his girlfriend.
Who's that cute girl?
You have gained weight.
I wanted to be aggressive.
I feel like you don't really care about me.
I know you did that.
Oscar hasn't yet admitted he did that.
James and Monica are planning on staying in Australia until October.
"Did you like my apartment?" "Yes, it is very comfortable."
I should've listened to my mother.
The street lights went on.
A woman George didn't know approached him.
I thought that you said you weren't attracted to Adam.
I don't have a TV.
I don't think I need to be here any longer.
Tommy will be coming over this afternoon.
I'm almost finished doing that.
Adam has been here as long as I can remember.
Where is the highest point on earth?
Jack said he didn't have to do that right now.
Both Charlie and Mary are happy.
The boy who's swimming over there with Olivia is my younger brother.
Is Muhammad still in school?
James fell asleep on my couch.
I don't know what possessed me to do that.
I want to go by train.
You must come at once.
Does it look infected?
William is coming over for dinner tonight.
George already knows Alice wants to do that.
I waited for the answer but nobody answered.
Jacob is probably still lonely.
Aren't you ever going to sleep?
What's it going to take to persuade you?
It wasn't long before I got a call from Tommy.
What colour were they?
Jack could get injured if he tried to do that.
Laur told me she was hoping to get into Harvard.
"Are you two really dating?" "Sort of."
Jack wanted to be the one who did that for Eva.
Jack is likely to lie to Anna about where he spent the weekend.
I had no one but myself to blame.
I was home last night.
Emma said she doesn't want to do that on her own.
I want to learn Chinese next year.
I had no idea Jack was Lucy's husband.
You looked like you were miserable.
Jami isn't the one in charge.
George said you're a better singer than Emma is.
Who's her father?
Has this ever been done before?
I've already told Adam what he has to do.
Muhammad went back to Boston yesterday.
Try to open the door.
I don't think that I could ever live in Australia.
That doesn't any make sense.
Don't tip it over.
Alex said that he isn't sure that Laur can swim.
Joe and Mary want you to do that for them.
Jami and Susie are drinking.
I'm not so simple as to believe you.
Alex isn't young anymore.
Not everyone here can speak French.
I knew that Charlie couldn't speak French.
Harry has really helped a lot of people.
Nobody knew where Oliver was.
He spilled soup on his shirt.
As soon as I have it, I'll forward it to you.
Mr White is doing very well so far.
Do you think you can do that without getting yourselves killed?
It's going to happen, but just not anytime soon.
Jacob wondered where Carmen was and what she was doing.
That place is open to everybody.
Laur cleaned out her bedroom closet.
I think this word is no longer used.
Margaret wouldn't tell me why she didn't do that.
Jack told me that I wouldn't be able to do that.
She was on the point of leaving.
She came around to my house.
I don't want to know anything about that.
I need him alive.
James can probably tell you where Olivia is.
We need his help.
Did Harry purchase it?
Food will be available.
Muhammad said that he doesn't really want that to happen.
I asked her to open the door.
I am not dead, but that doesn't stop me from being food.
I'm short of money.
Adam deserves a reward for that.
Joe and Anna say they don't plan to do that by themselves.
What do you propose?
We won't be able to finish this job today.
I think you might've been proud of George.
You'll ask her, won't you?
George and I got along very well.
Joe should've gotten home by now.
We knew it was going to be tough.
I understand that Jack and Julia do that.
I can't see anything. You're standing in the way.
I don't know what will happen next year.
I hope nothing goes wrong.
I, gay, view my heart.
That's the reason I started studying French.
Hasn't Tommy come home yet?
Listen and choose the best answer.
Tommy suggested that we study French.
If the symptoms get worse, you'll have to consult a medical professional.
George wasn't able to do what we asked.
Many trees were cut down.
How can one live without pork?
He told me he'd leave soon.
I don't think James and Carmen are qualified.
I play computer games.
Jack and Emma said that they weren't guilty.
Are you sure you don't need any help?
The paper I need is on my desk at home.
Harry said that Catherine probably couldn't do that without his help.
Of course, she was right in the middle.
Muhammad explained the purpose of the project to Alice.
France and Spain have a common border.
Do you watch television?
I really miss you a lot!
Oscar told me that he would go to Boston.
I haven't called the police yet.
Where should I put these books?
Since I had a cold, I didn't go to school.
I like working here.
Which film did you see?
Oscar didn't drive.
Alex and Monica were sitting at the kitchen table, talking.
It is good to see you.
You know how to swim, don't you?
What part of my explanation didn't you understand?
I've already told Oliver that I don't plan to do that.
I've been really tired all day.
I know that I'll be punished for doing that.
I have three sons.
Your role here is so important.
Albert is quick at learning.
The airport is closed.
I know that you won't disappoint me.
Tommy cried because he was so happy.
You speak.
Are you in this picture?
I don't understand why all of these are necessary.
Try to keep up.
Look someplace else.
He told me he couldn't breathe.
We don't know that for a fact.
I know it wasn't them.
Tell her I said hi.
Jami realized there was no way he'd be able to do that without some help.
That coat looks good on Adam.
William and Alice are close relatives.
Charlie and Emma said that they didn't feel tired.
Did Joe force you not to do that?
Do you think Jack made a right decision?
I told Adam not to waste his time trying to convince Susie to do that.
Oliver watches TV all the time.
I'm impressed by how well you speak French.
I know I was supposed to do that.
You had better go at once.
Jacob is somewhere here in the park.
This book gives a good picture of life in America during the Civil War.
I felt a certain anxiety in my chest.
Oliver was the one who did this for you.
This information must not fall into enemy hands.
He's got a joker.
We should read at least one book a month.
Her purse is the same color as her shoes.
Jack probably doesn't know who did that to Alice.
I will attend the party only if Alice will not.
I'm absolutely sure I did nothing wrong.
Jami ended up not buying the car he was looking at last week.
Could you arrange to be here at five?
He's already sleeping.
Why do you always do that to me?
My suitcase isn't where I left it.
How often do you wash your clothes?
There's something I want you to hear.
I don't have any clothes on.
This is a no-swimming zone.
I didn't think what Jacob said made any sense.
She was right the first time.
Joe already left.
Jacob said that he didn't have any bad habits.
You were very happy.
I quit my job.
Nobody knows the truth.
She is extremely patient.
I don't want to eat with you.
Jacob is intelligent, isn't he?
Alex couldn't hear it, but Susie could.
It's way too big.
George ate alone.
I found that hard to do.
I didn't know that I'd hurt anybody.
There were various articles in the room.
James's girlfriend is older than mine.
You have to get up at the crack of dawn.
How many songs did Tommy and Laur sing together?
Rain is the water that falls from the clouds.
That kind of machine is yet to be invented.
James asked Lucy to say a few words.
Is there a cheaper way to do that?
Alex didn't want Alice to come to the party.
She turned pale with fear.
For more information, get in touch with us.
I don't think it's going to happen.
I'm sure both Oliver and Catherine are OK.
Oscar was taken advantage of by Anna.
Maybe you can tell me where I can find Jacob.
I had to stop them.
Muhammad told me it was too hard for him to do that.
I wasn't wearing socks, so my feet got cold.
Oscar doesn't like it when people park in front of his house.
I can't lie to them.
So Noah went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.
Alice told me she'd wait until we got there.
She told me that she's suspicious.
I heard everything you said.
You're expected to do that, too.
William and Alice don't know they're not supposed to do that anymore.
Neither Tommy nor Emma has a chance of winning.
Muhammad and Alice haven't yet realized that they've made mistake.
They serve food there.
Alex should talk to me.
My father is to go to London on business.
Alex is hiding something from you.
Children want to hear the same story over and over again.
We'll make camp near the lake.
I know you don't often do that in the morning.
The convention opened as planned.
It's all very confusing.
I don't think William wants to do that.
Muhammad can take anything he wants.
I've already explained that to Adam.
I just say what William tells me to say.
Don't tell me you don't know anything about that.
You can have as much as you want.
I knew that Jami was a busy man.
I should've become a teacher.
We walked ten miles that day.
You could've let me know you were going to be late.
In most sports the team that practice hardest usually brings home the bacon.
Thank you for helping me do that.
It'll be OK.
I wonder whether or not Jacob wants to go to Australia with us.
What you said made me angry.
It follows from this that the company is not responsible for the accident.
The doctor told George to stay in bed and get as much rest as he could.
You think I really needed to do that, don't you?
Tommy didn't seem to be in any pain.
Jacob was the unlucky one.
I'm going back to Australia tomorrow.
Jack wrote poems when he was in high school.
Do you mind much?
They checked how pure the water was.
Jack never lived in Boston.
The boy wearing the purple baseball cap is Charlie.
She transferred from the bus to the subway.
He said he needed to do that.
It is remarkable for her not to understand.
The tall woman is beautiful.
This is Christmas!
Joe is the one who broke the window.
Mr Long and Mr Smith spoke to each other.
You never seem to be interested in going anywhere.
It got dark, and what was worse, it began to rain.
It is necessary for you to think about your life.
Muhammad knows he's got to do that today.
I'm surprised you didn't know that Jack didn't have to do that.
I didn't agree to go to Australia with Oscar.
I've been sick for a very long time.
Raise your leg.
To think what we do not feel is to lie to ourselves, in the same way that we lie to others when we say what we do not think.
You are not a child anymore.
Please don't start that again.
She said she wasn't coming.
You have to be extra careful around Tommy.
Help yourself.
Oscar may be right.
Catherine took her children to the park.
Tell her not to come.
We'll help you look for her.
I'm calling Boston.
That's a little weird.
I wonder what they're planning.
If I had known your email address, I would've written.
Charlie had a lot more money than Catherine.
You could've said no.
Come on Monday afternoon, if possible.
Joe and Monica said they were prepared.
Tommy knows very little about Australia.
It smells like fish.
They must've arrived home by this time.
Don't tell them you're a cop.
You're so mean, James!
You drink too much!
Harry knew he didn't have to do that.
This room isn't large enough.
Here's a copy.
I really wish you wouldn't do that.
She says she's not tired yet.
Tommy and John are dating sisters.
Can I get a copy of that?
I didn't mean to say that you couldn't join us.
Anna looked well the last time I saw her.
Muhammad will be there this afternoon.
I think everyone knows this one is true!
They said they didn't do that anymore.
I hope you're not hurt.
I think Harry might get fired.
Could you please lend me thirty dollars?
Where did you end up going?
Loving is the essence of life.
What will become of the child?
What do you want to watch?
I would like to introduce myself.
I think that Joe is going to die.
I don't think Jacob wanted to do that.
What was she thinking?
It was pretty scary.
Clouds sail across the sky.
Oliver is getting ready to leave for Boston.
He is short but strong.
I think Adam is still living in Boston.
I told them I agreed with them.
Just don't laugh.
I don't think that we really need to do that.
Try not to disturb her.
She has an important air about her.
Jacob has two brothers. Both of them are doctors.
It may seem obvious to Adam, but it doesn't seem obvious to me.
You can't force me to do anything I don't want to do.
I come to Boston about once a month.
No one else spoke.
I know that Jacob doesn't know why Laur didn't do that.
There's nothing left to be done.
He brought his daughter to work.
I had to push my bicycle home.
James doesn't have time right now to help you.
George looks like he's half asleep.
Do you believe most of what you read and see in the news?
I have to face reality.
He's writing.
He says he never taught French.
I'm trying to calm her down.
Tommy said that he watched TV for three hours last night.
I worry too much.
Nobody is being refused service.
I am married and I have two sons.
James's house has a big backyard with a large oak tree.
They say they enjoy speaking French.
I don't remember sending that text.
Roll the ball to me.
Oscar isn't going to go away.
I heard that both Charlie and Susie have died.
Did you really think that Jack wouldn't help you?
Everything is getting more expensive. Only the excuses are getting cheaper.
I don't know where Muhammad parked the car.
I don't think Jami and Carmen need to worry.
I love practical jokes.
Who invented the telephone?
William said he didn't think Carmen would do that.
That's a big difference.
It has been raining since last Sunday.
I want you to know I appreciate your help.
I don't think James should ask Lucy to do that.
I didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that this morning.
Oliver and Susie are waiting at the park entrance.
He couldn't bring himself to believe her story.
My parents love him.
There's nothing left to discuss.
It wasn't a maintenance problem.
In the morning I always wake up around seven o'clock.
Everything is going to be alright tomorrow.
Jack built a wall around his house.
Your answer is not to the point.
I want to be a teacher.
Let us help one another.
I talked to Jack again.
Have you already received my package?
Harry can speak French much better than Monica.
I feel quite bad.
Visiting hours are almost over.
I told Oscar and Susie that I wasn't interested in working for them.
Joe fell asleep reading a book.
Jami had no idea that Maria felt that way.
I wanted you to help me do that.
Oscar said that Susie is happy that she was able to do that.
I had to keep busy, so I wouldn't think about what had happened.
I think that you shouldn't have called Charlie.
Do you really think it would be silly to do that?
I want to sit down for a change.
I asked for food.
He hadn't eaten all day long and was very hungry.
I want to remind you that you have a 2:30 appointment.
I don't want her to see that.
I told you I don't know anything.
All of the toys are wooden.
"I love you." "I love you too."
I guess Oliver and Olivia were in Boston.
I should've been watching more carefully.
I just left her.
Is it warm in here or is it just me?
I never heard from him again.
I told her not to tell you.
All of us went except for him.
Jacob broke up with his girlfriend.
Oscar said goodbye to his sister.
I think Alex is exciting.
I didn't want to go to school.
Oscar waited in the parking lot.
What did I forget to say?
I'd rather stay here than go to Jacob's.
Do it the way he tells you to.
You aren't very hungry, are you?
Muhammad cares more than you think.
How do you say "pasta" in Italian?
Stop telling me it is my baby.
Harry let me use his computer.
It's a cheap restaurant.
I've seen the incident for a short time.
I think Alex wouldn't be pleased by that.
The dog is trying to escape.
George and Susie started packing their things up.
The cat didn't move a muscle.
Workers lost their jobs.
Look at my new car.
Oscar and Anna aren't expecting me to do that, are they?
He's forever telling the same story.
Carmen is a country girl.
It isn't easy to understand why you want to leave.
Emma will wait as long as you tell her to.
I'll be late.
She says she tried to do that once.
I don't want to say that to Charlie.
Ask for his advice.
Where do William and Anna want to eat?
Never again did I see you.
Please leave.
Please don't treat me like this.
I do not speak Chinese.
She was thirty when she died.
Shut up or I'll throw you in jail.
What's going to happen to your prisoners?
I'm happy each time I hear this.
Jami wants to see his son.
I didn't eat as much meat as you did.
Mary would've kept her mouth shut.
You seemed surprised when Alex and Laur told you they wanted to do that.
Do you really want to marry him?
Oscar slept for only three hours.
He is one of my dearest friends.
To know a language is one thing, and to teach it is another.
Anna sacrificed her own life in order to save William.
I'm on my way to see her.
I wonder whether a person can live on only two hours of sleep a night.
Jacob wasn't the only other person who didn't do that.
This stuff is amazing.
Tommy's car isn't here, so he must have already left.
Is this going to take long?
I've never actually tortured anybody.
Dan's book gained so much fame.
I know Oliver wouldn't be doing that if he didn't know how.
We both need this.
I would've shown you how to do if you'd asked me.
She showed her regret over the serious mistake.
We took a good place to see the parade.
They began to run when they saw the police.
We're leaving Australia next Monday.
This suitcase is Jack's.
It's a really cool car.
Harry didn't know Julia would swim.
They said they noticed a difference.
Come on over here.
I had a kidney stone.
James and Catherine tried not to show their fear.
Susie is going to have to do that by herself.
It was the best day of my life.
James is stupid sometimes.
I'm extremely mad right now.
He has sold his car, so he goes to the office by train.
I'm pretty sure Tommy said he wasn't planning to do that.
Alex is a physician.
I don't want to kill anybody.
William didn't tell the police everything.
Would you like me to cook something for you?
Be a good person.
Who were you just talking to?
Take the phone.
They do whatever they want.
I'm going to give it to them.
We'll never work for them.
Adam doesn't seem like himself.
The book that I'm planning to read next weekend is in French.
It's no use trying to convince William.
I'm anxious to see your stuff.
I see no cause for alarm.
Harry will probably not do that.
I'd like to have a coffee.
She told me she was a doctor.
I haven't ever studied French.
I hadn't waited long before he came along.
I don't think I ought to do that with Harry.
You can't mean that.
He's reading a novel now.
Tommy didn't yet know what he should do.
Carmen has lost her touch.
You're happy, aren't you?
I have a long vacation coming up.
She told me how it was wrong to steal.
I would never permit Oscar to do that.
We have to drive back home to Boston tomorrow.
What helps with a cough?
I wonder if Joe is exhausted.
Where are my parents?
He's a filthy liar.
Do I really need to do that for you?
Tennis is my favourite sport.
That car salesman isn't honest.
No, you're wrong.
Muhammad thought that Susie was beautiful.
Which one?
Charlie said that he liked the movie.
Why are the nights so dark?
He is a locked nature.
After four hours in the museum we're tired.
I had planned to leave for New York the next morning.
They don't seem too happy, do they?
How often do you drink instant coffee?
I have a lot of experience.
Tommy says he has to go to Boston next week.
Jack flew to Boston to attend his daughter's wedding.
Everyone wants to beat us.
I would love nothing more, trust me.
I'm thirty years old.
Muhammad made a list of places he wants to visit.
I take my hat off to James.
Oscar told Mary and me that we should do that by ourselves.
Catherine said she knew what Alex was going to do.
I admire him.
I asked Jack where he lived.
He looked like he was dead.
People in every walk of life go to church.
I thought that you were planning on going to Boston.
My favorite food is ice cream.
No one saw me take it.
Oscar should be here within fifteen minutes.
Oliver and Margaret claim they never wanted to do that.
I know quite a lot about Harry.
That man is going on trial next week.
I had enough money to buy everything I needed to buy.
She was better than I expected.
I don't think that Oscar is cute.
She doesn't live here any more.
Is this my life?
We miss her.
The campaign seems to be going like a bomb.
I often hear people say that.
Two years ago, Oscar learned how to swim.
Why don't you let Jack know you can't do that?
The wedding cake didn't taste very good.
Oscar knew that Lucy wasn't in Australia.
Does Jacob know that you're going to Australia?
I don't think that Tommy expected me to do that.
Jack will probably figure out how to do that.
Valentina must realize what she's done.
I know that you have something you want to say.
I'm sure Harry doesn't want to be the first one to do that.
Can you give me a permission to enter here?
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
Nobody knew Joe and Margaret were here.
Do you recognize these?
It's been hard living here by myself.
I didn't doubt my abilities.
That house appears deserted.
That'll be difficult.
Suppose it were true, what would you do?
It's important to back up claims with evidence.
Oliver left a few minutes later.
We promised to stand by him in case of trouble.
William and I arrived in Boston at the same time.
Why don't you go check on that?
Harry told me that he thought that Laur was prepared.
I remember seeing you before.
You think you're so smart...
Harry's studies soon attracted interest.
Tommy is a close friend of Susie's.
Why am I smoking with this sore throat?
Joe said that he couldn't loan any money to Mary.
I want you to come home now.
Cheer up! Things are not so bad as you think.
You should obey your parents.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
Everybody likes them.
"I'm not very good at this." "Neither am I."
Charlie wasn't the one who taught me how to play this song.
Can't we tell Charlie?
What's that got to do with her?
I know I'll be happy when George gets home.
Oliver is about to leave for Australia.
The snow's a foot deep.
Is Muhammad going to be here?
Joe is going to get in trouble if he eats all the ice cream.
I can't fall asleep.
You've found it.
She should get a new computer.
Have you been married for a long time?
Don't blame yourself for what happened to Joe.
She's lightning-fast.
Where is the lift?
What a cute baby! May I hold her?
My room is number five.
Joe thought would embarrass Mary.
Harry died of a heart attack in Boston.
You're the only one who doesn't seem happy.
Do you think Charlie and Olivia would like me to show them how to do that?
Maybe I hurt them.
Are you going to spend Christmas with Muhammad?
I've been married to my husband for twenty years.
I know William already knows why Julia didn't need to do that.
He said he's not tired.
I don't think Jami and Carmen are awake.
I'm committed to this.
There are a lot of English books in this library.
She made fun of a student.
Harry wasn't the one who told me that I didn't have do that.
Now it's our turn.
Do you think Jack went to Australia?
James knew that he'd done something he shouldn't have.
It worked perfectly.
Alex says he needs a hat.
The factory was shut down ten years ago.
Look, what's this all about?
Joe and Julia did what they felt like doing.
Did I accept to write this?
I like to listen to classical music while I work.
There is a lot at stake.
George is a normal teenage boy.
I thought that you said you wanted to do that right away.
George said he thought that he'd need to do that tomorrow.
Please give me a spare blanket.
George is going to be a doctor.
Doing that wasn't as hard as I expected.
Joe had no idea what the woman was talking about.
I can't tell her now. It's not that simple.
Jack works for the phone company.
I hope what we've done helped.
No one came to help us.
Is it normal for male teachers to make eyes at female students?
Muhammad didn't change his plans.
Alex didn't seem to like your cooking.
I think that this is the first time Oscar has done that without help.
He hid himself in the closet.
Oliver isn't sure he's ready.
She has a perfect body.
Perhaps Adam really didn't write this letter.
Here's the answer to your question.
Am I the only one who cares?
I'll get in touch with Jack.
I'm pretty drunk right now.
Adam said that he hoped Valentina would do that.
Adam is going to be very hurt if you don't do that.
That's incredible.
We haven't contacted each other for quite a while. I am very happy to write to you.
I'm talking to William.
I wouldn't tell them what they wanted to know.
William and Eva were playing football.
We didn't mean to hurt her.
Only the elected President may deliver an opening address.
She has her toes in the water.
Do you want to know why I don't like Jack?
Don't you think it's strange that he's not here?
This is amazing.
You could've invited me.
I'm tired of talking to you about this.
You knew I wasn't going to be able to convince Adam to do that, didn't you?
I can do that for him, you can't.
You've got a lot of stuff going on at the moment, so why don't you take the rest of the week off to deal with whatever those issues are?
Muhammad told Lucy that he'd forgiven her.
Joe and Olivia said that they felt great.
James and Laur said they thought they might be required to do that by themselves.
This is not a mistake.
Adam invited me personally.
Oscar is a talented actor, isn't he?
The competition was absolutely amazing.
Oscar said that he thought that Laur might not need to do that this week.
She picked up a stone.
I want you to lie still for a few hours.
You're winning.
He made me feel like such an idiot.
Ask Emma if she really needs to be there by 2:30.
Olivia told me that she needed money.
I don't think Oliver knows where Carmen is now.
If only I had known.
Harry thought Alice was embarrassed.
I don't expect that they will support my view.
Oscar didn't think that was going to happen.
Oliver told Julia about the job he'd been offered.
You often do that by yourself, don't you?
I was not studying then.
I feel ill at ease with her.
I suppose you enjoy that sort of thing.
Harry told Margaret that he didn't think John was downstairs.
Which father loves his son?
I know that Adam and Olivia are outside.
I don't think Harry and Eva like you very much.
We didn't have time to do things like this.
I can't lead this lifestyle.
I'll talk with him tonight.
Adam asked Emma if she knew what kind of music John liked.
She asked him how to turn on the machine.
They helped us.
Harry said he'll visit Australia.
Charlie sat down on the bench next to me.
Alex said that he thought Anna was mad.
I think you've told me all I need to know.
I am collecting money to save the sea turtles.
Only the teachers did that.
I think that Jami will eventually give up and let somebody else do that.
I doubt that Joe is still downstairs.
She hasn't been paying her rent.
Will you let me make an observation?
Who was the girl you were talking to?
Charlie is listening to the news.
I listen to the sounds of nature, far from the noise of the traffic.
Emma says she's forgotten how to do that.
This is the first time I've ever treated a wounded person.
I'm going go get some help.
The tall man is handsome.
There's a secret clue here.
There's only two days left.
Let's get your coat.
Can you still hear that?
He's back from his travels in Central Asia.
Jami heard about the murder from Valentina.
I'm doing the best I can to keep my promise.
Mary said she didn't know any better.
Thank you for preparing meals for me while I was sick in bed.
Are you suggesting that I can't do it by myself?
He said he doesn't know.
Are you still at the office?
I'd love to have more children.
Harry is a mild-mannered man.
I'm not going to wait for him.
Charlie should have let Monica do that.
That's the funny thing.
Dark clouds are a sign of rain.
Jami apparently used to work in Boston.
You've gotten used to having Alex around, haven't you?
Everybody made for the door at the signal.
William said he didn't need to do that today.
Jacob knew that I was sick.
This is how I solved the difficult problem.
The child who ate almost all this cake must be very fat.
Can you find someone to help?
This is completely safe.
Why don't you just say you don't like Chinese food?
The news can't all be bad.
Tell her I'm in the office.
Some college teachers come to class late and leave early.
What kind of book do you want?
There's one law for the rich, and another for the poor.
What's that there?
Jami can't leave Boston until next Monday.
Alex is going to buy that for you.
I don't know why she isn't in my dreams. Maybe she doesn't want to be there in order not to disturb me.
You don't even like swimming.
Jack said that he didn't think that we should call the police.
We should've done that last week.
I had all the money stolen and was in trouble.
Jami must have retired or died.
Joe divorced Lucy last year.
I told Oscar Margaret didn't have to do that.
That worked.
The old city is a popular tourist destination.
I have plenty of money with me.
What haven't you done?
He's asking for it.
Monica just admitted she made a mistake.
I'd like to have the translation of this song.
The car pulled up in front of the bank.
Oscar isn't the one who taught Julia how to ride a bicycle.
Who are you to decide that?
Does Jami still want me to teach him French?
Adam and Olivia asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with them.
The fire burned down ten houses.
We are really late.
I think Mr. Jackson's first name is Jacob.
I thought for sure we'd be killed.
Don't leave library books here.
I wasn't able to understand what Jacob was trying to say.
Harry couldn't jump that far.
That day it had looked like rain since morning.
Oliver's a doctor.
Please give me your honest opinion.
I wasn't expecting you until 2:30.
I thought you always played football on Saturday.
There's someone I have to get in touch with in Boston.
Valentina did the only thing she could.
I'm ready and willing, Jack.
William was holding a gun.
Emma asked Harry to wait for her in front of the library.
Muhammad asked me to lend Laur some money.
I look terrible today.
James figured out a way to do that.
I still dream about Germany.
We were not jealous.
There's no one home.
I bought a box lunch at the station.
I'd better not eat that.
I'm very pleased to meet you too.
Bill is nervous about the exam.
That's exactly what she wanted.
I don't have enough money now to buy this.
I wonder if we can do that.
Tomorrow is the only day I plan on swimming that.
Did Muhammad say anything about who Mary was with?
I thought that George wouldn't like doing that.
I think Harry went upstairs.
We're asking you to talk to us.
I think Adam and Lucy have fallen in love.
I think that Joe can understand French.
How is your grandmother?
He will be here all evening.
She is sleeping.
I couldn't have done this without Muhammad's help.
She revealed the secret to him.
That can cause big problems.
He decided to come.
I have a long list of things I need to buy..
Father has recently come back to Japan.
Why are you cleaning the office?
We need to be more aggressive.
Look, this isn't that big of a deal.
Never put off until tomorrow what you can do the day after tomorrow.
Jack isn't as efficient as Olivia.
I didn't know Alex was such a talented singer.
I knew it would be easy.
I'm still a little tired.
Jami was my boss.
I don't think that I want to do that.
George had this coming.
Oscar started screaming.
I'll join you there later.
James was unable to decide who he should vote for.
I went to the lawyer for legal help.
Let's walk toward town.
I have a very good opinion of Harry.
This will teach that he must obey the law.
Jami looked like he'd been crying.
The new furniture came today.
William and Julia said they thought they could do that.
It seems something's wrong with my computer.
I thought William said he wasn't planning to do that.
I'm looking forward to working with you.
You can speak English.
Mary was late for her shift.
Something important has come up.
I forbid you to speak with anyone about what just happened.
"Where are you going now?" "Straight home: farewell." "Farewell to you too."
It'd be good if you came alone?
Nothing seems to happen around here.
Jami was strict, but Anna wasn't.
I want you to do that before you go home.
I can't recall her name.
I'm pretty sure both Charlie and Monica have done that.
I promised Adam that I wouldn't stay in Boston for more than three days.
It's not something that anyone would be ashamed of.
Alice got mad at me for not listening to her.
Do you think Charlie can really win?
He says he loves me.
William and Laur moved to Boston soon after they got married.
Susie is a history teacher, isn't she?
If you need a pen, I can lend you one.
I don't know what you don't want me to know, so I don't know what I want to know.
I know Tommy doesn't know why I did that on Monday.
I hope nobody feels that way.
He is very friendly to her.
Olivia knew where she'd put her keys.
What's the email?
Alex said he knew why Lucy wanted to do that.
He checked his notes.
I never thought I'd do that.
It's been two years since I saw him last.
His eyes locked with mine.
You should face the reality.
I didn't give it to him.
Valentina thought she needed to help James.
I was in Boston most of the summer.
I don't think their plan will work out.
I know James is a very nice guy.
Joe was sweating.
She and her mother were extremely close.
Did you enjoy your swim?
Tommy and Eva told Tommy that they weren't planning on doing that.
Would you like me to hold onto it?
What can I do about this?
I believe Adam is doing well.
They say that they're prepared to do that.
Today is the first and the last day for me.
George and I worked together in Australia.
Harry told John that he would ask Julia to the dance only if John asked Alice.
Jack will confirm that.
I don't want anything to do with William.
Well, it's about time.
I'm not your mother.
I have to eat, too.
Mary didn't know she was supposed to do that.
She asked me out on a date.
He's closing everything.
You mustn't use my pen.
He said that he was really thirsty.
Everyone knows Jack has a thing for you.
In the United States, 20 million new jobs have been created during the past two decades, most of them in the service sector.
Oh, it's cool. I like it.
They told me about their new jobs.
We must have made a mistake.
Alex said he was too drunk to help Anna do that.
Return good for evil.
I'm going to lose.
Tell Oscar I'll be right there.
Margaret didn't tell me she'd gotten fired.
A cold beer would hit the spot!
How many hours a day does Oliver swim?
This place is different.
I'm pretty sure Tommy hasn't done anything he wasn't supposed to do.
Why don't you sing for us?
I'm pretty sure Alex likes you.
We're not going to find anything.
Ask an expert first!
Why did Alex want to help Lucy?
I have a feeling this will be an even better year!
I don't always wear a hat.
Does Tommy know what you're doing?
Was it you who forgot to lock the door?
She wants to live closer to nature.
Adam wanted to be in Boston last Monday.
Jacob doesn't seem to know who we are.
This is his first novel.
They lost the war on the eastern front.
I taught French many years ago.
I visited Jami last spring in Australia.
It'd be about time to reply to his letter.
Jacob and Monica are already married.
Where is the license?
I didn't do that, because I was sick.
Jami and Mary are a lot different now.
You're going to have to do that by yourself, aren't you?
He has not failed for nothing.
Don't tell Monica. I don't want to worry her.
When Anna entered the kitchen, the floor was covered in water.
You flew.
Jack didn't flush the toilet.
What just happened in there?
I feel sad, but I don't know why.
You've been well paid.
The others have to try and catch the murderer.
We have to get her to a doctor.
When did you arrive there?
James and Margaret got married on Christmas Eve.
The role of a lawyer is to prove that his client is innocent.
Adam has been asked to leave already.
I thought you weren't supposed to do that by yourself.
Harry understands French fairly well, but he has trouble speaking it.
Julia had no choice but to do what she'd been told to do.
I went to the hospital to have me checked so that they can find the cause of my disease.
I still make mistakes.
Catherine is very arrogant, isn't she?
You can speak German.
There's hardly any wind today.
He is young and ambitious.
Charlie and Julia are really pleased.
I didn't want to do it that way.
Alex should tell Lucy he's sleepy.
We were born on the same day.
Harry was looking for the man who tried to break into his car.
Alex seemed to be tired this evening.
I could tell you who did it.
I don't think Alex knows he's not likely to be fired.
Laur asked me to meet her at the station.
I want an answer from you as soon as possible.
I think that Adam would be happier if he did that.
This desk is too small for him.
I think Oliver and Julia are rich.
Muhammad should have been a lawyer.
Charlie made a very big mistake.
She was careful not to break the glasses.
Charlie isn't alone in thinking that Monica is the most beautiful girl in his class.
You know Harry can't do that.
That's what you've always wanted.
Harry and Alice had to admit that they were too tired to do anything else.
James and Anna walk their dog at least once a day.
I want to name our son Joe.
This is very important to us.
How did Jami know you were going to do that?
Let's find someplace quiet to talk.
Didn't you know Joe and Valentina were asleep?
He read his children a story.
Jami and Monica made their positions clear.
What do you think of this place?
I don't know if I can wait that long.
The blood test is normal.
Emma asked me if she could hold my hand.
That is our father.
She fell in love with her boyfriend's younger brother.
Are you coming to the party tonight?
I'm resting my legs.
I take a walk every day except when it rains.
Harry doesn't have my permission to do that.
Carmen hopes that she doesn't have to do that again.
Oliver and Olivia said that they didn't really have to do that.
Lucy looks like she's ready.
Harry stood in front of a full-length mirror, looking at himself.
Tell Muhammad and Alice that we're not going to help them.
I know Muhammad is a butcher.
It looks like Joe is crying.
Monica can't get rid of her cough.
I was late again this morning, which made my boss angry.
He isn't happy at all.
There was blood on William's pillow.
My brother pretended to be working very hard.
I should have paid a little more attention.
Olivia soon realized she was trapped.
They say that they can't help.
On finishing university, I started working right away.
I read one.
Do you remember the first time that we spoke to each other?
I know that James is the one who's supposed to tell Monica that she has to do that.
Jami and Catherine want to live in a country where French is spoken.
The only problem was that we didn't know how to do that.
Adam told me that he wanted to become a famous singer.
Emma said she thought Harry would probably do that.
It began to dawn.
Jacob told Anna that he wouldn't ever do that again.
I don't use crack cocaine.
Are you going to go with James?
Why didn't you come to ask me earlier?
I think that George could easily have done that.
I don't like the way he speaks.
Charlie wants to speak to you at 2:30.
Tommy and Alice have both already eaten.
I wonder if William will cry.
Alex and Susie are younger than you think they are.
Joe wasn't at home.
She's a girl.
Jacob was my friend, too.
Tommy said he'd do that for you if you asked him to.
I don't think that we should compromise.
I looked at Jack and laughed.
Julia asked me to go to a movie with her.
I assumed that that's what you'd wanted to do.
Having finished her work, she went home.
Does he have a car in Japan?
Did you know Jami was going to say that?
I'm not looking forward to doing that.
I think I can go to Australia with you next week.
I'm sorry Adam wasn't able the conference.
The cat was killed by the dog.
The man in the street is eating pizza and actually thinks voting machines are OK.
Tommy wants some alone time.
This is three, twenty-five off your next shop.
I don't earn enough money to support a family.
Mother made me a pure white dress.
I passed my French examination.
We are full just now.
I don't know what you've done.
Jami said he wished that he hadn't given Olivia any money.
Tommy has nothing left.
I didn't think Oliver really needed to do that by himself.
She said that she felt left out.
Didn't you know that Oliver and Emma weren't planning to attend today's meeting?
I promised Jack I'd go shopping with him.
That's my complaint.
Oliver bought some flowers.
This really feels good.
This desert looks like an alien landscape.
Joe wrapped his jacket around my shoulders.
You may want to slow down a bit.
You seemed to be doing that very well.
Jacob seems to be cold.
I didn't speak to Jacob.
Tommy said that Carmen wanted to do that soon.
Valentina said she thought that we could win.
James said Monica knew John might want to do that as quickly as possible.
Maybe Oscar couldn't afford to buy a ticket.
That's Oscar, my teddy-bear.
Oscar kept his distance.
Alex is going to try to be there on time.
I never realized how much I'd miss you.
Everyone agreed that it was the right decision.
I didn't run away.
Jack had a very hard time doing that.
How do I apologize for this?
I won't tell anyone that you're in Boston.
This soap makes a lot bubbles.
You should have given Jacob another chance.
Jack is arrogant, but Catherine isn't.
You're doing great work.
How accurate do you think this report is?
Were you the one who told Charlie that he shouldn't go?
I want to finish eating before Tommy and Anna get here.
Make a list.
William will give Carmen what she asked for.
Nature is not threatened by man.
Adam is probably going to be stubborn about that.
Oscar said Valentina was likely to be present at the meeting on October 20th.
We need to avoid a scandal at all costs.
We agreed to start early the next morning.
Charlie and Eva didn't want to make fools of themselves.
This song was written by Foster.
Harry said that he'd be doing that soon.
I didn't know you would do that with us.
What is important for you?
I hope the bus comes soon.
From time to time, he goes to Tokyo on business.
Try not to disturb Oliver.
She needn't have gone in such a hurry.
Everybody started to panic.
James said that he wished he hadn't seen Olivia doing that.
Bit by bit, he could attract her with his behaviour.
They have sugar.
I can walk.
I don't think you want to take that chance.
Harry is Emma's only friend in Boston.
They told me they wanted a lawyer.
Adam, Alice and a few other people did that.
My name is Thomas, but you can call me Jacob.
Our cat fought with someone's else's cat.
Would it make you happy to live the life that you're now living for all eternity?
Muhammad and Carmen hope they'll get a chance to do that again.
Oscar told me how he got his nickname.
Nature made sure that living happily doesn't require much effort: everyone can make himself happy.
Why not let us try?
Get her in here.
You like watches, don't you?
Are you afraid to stand on the edge?
What is the book about?
I wonder whether Oliver will be at Catherine's party tonight.
Why are you looking for a job?
Can I have a cup of coffee first?
Jami ran to a neighbor for help.
Tommy didn't want to come to Australia.
It may be too late already.
A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
Susie is studying in her room.
Joe wanted to tell you something.
I want to go to Seattle.
He said that he'd help.
You seem to be really happy.
I'm friends with her brother.
So why don't you quit?
Alex couldn't remember exactly what Anna had said.
Emma is very talented, isn't she?
I'm not sure if Jami will do that again.
They looked up from their books.
Oliver seems to be trying to stir up trouble.
She lost the key to her room.
It was one of the best experiences of my life.
Do you have anything?
"Who helped you?" "No one. I did everything myself."
We're heading out.
We're not quite sure exactly what we're supposed to be doing.
Anna was unable to finish her lunch.
James isn't nearly as smart as he thinks he is.
He ran away as soon as he saw me.
This sentence requires a question mark at the end.
I have just a few more questions.
I thought that we'd managed to do it right.
We're better than you.
Who broke it?
What do you want to become of me?
I don't believe you really want to do that.
Joe will never have to worry about going hungry.
The boys fought over her.
I'll take you to Jack.
Oscar found a good place for me to live.
How many people are in your family?
Alex did get the last laugh, though.
Can I borrow your rubber for a moment?
You should trying selling your products online.
My parents can't wait to meet you.
Muhammad has promised to change things.
She was kind enough to take me to the hospital.
Mother bought a beautiful doll for her.
Julia said that she was very glad she didn't do that.
I think we should do that again.
I thought that Oliver had stopped dating Susie.
Is that Jami's?
You sent the books from your house.
This isn't our final destination.
Where do you plan to stay in Australia?
I'm your new partner.
What do you want me to do with Muhammad?
I have a lot of enemies.
Can this happen again?
I am going to my friend's house.
The two of us are finally alone.
The last time George was seen alive was in October.
It's nice here in the sun.
Adam is going to be very depressed.
George was a popular guy.
I'll be staying in Boston all next week.
James gladly agreed.
With her stomach full of milk, the baby fell asleep.
We should all stick together.
I'm kind of busy, too.
Charlie said he wished that he hadn't asked Eva to do that.
He asked his girlfriend to borrow her mother's umbrella.
You knew that Oliver wasn't really going to do that, didn't you?
He said he'd call me.
She returned to her room.
I tend to agree.
Jack will be staying here for a while.
Did you not know that?
I have a friend who knows Jack.
We will just have to make the best of it.
I won't let Harry and Catherine do that.
Lift your left leg.
I didn't recognize him at first on the train.
Emma will be jealous.
I know that James used to be a police officer.
Tommy allowed Monica to go alone.
All of a sudden they stopped talking.
I took your advice.
Jami is under a lot of stress.
I am hoping to put an end to our unhappy relationship.
Tommy told me that he wouldn't do what I wanted him to do.
I read a book while eating.
We can tell Tommy later.
I think you've been reading too many comic books.
Mary told me that she wanted a lawyer.
I can't stand much more of this.
This room is too dark.
How does it help us?
Please continue until I tell you to stop.
I think Jack would like to be in Australia now.
Why did Oscar not want to go to Boston?
I'd like to spend more time with you.
I thought that Oscar didn't like cats.
Tommy and Laur told me they were looking for John.
I hope that you will enjoy this sentence.
Jacob is probably already there.
He said that he was ashamed.
Oscar said Valentina was in Australia now.
Oscar should've been home.
I guess James was in Australia.
I think that Jami and I are happier than most people.
Teach us how to do that.
I'll put in a good word for you.
Whose is the book on the desk?
Harry said he wanted to be left alone.
I was surprised to find it on fire.
It started right on schedule.
I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn.
Jack said that he now regrets his decision.
Oliver said Mary knew that he might not want to do that.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a child?
James is going to be lonely if Olivia leaves.
I know that Harry and Mary are as happy as I am.
You don't have to tell me what to do.
After we finished eating, we went for a walk.
I couldn't help with anything.
How many houses were destroyed in Iraq?
You've made many mistakes.
May contain nuts.
Only Jack can do that.
I told William he was right.
They said that they wanted my help.
There are things I have to know about.
Let's go before I change my mind.
Give it back to me.
I think Alex really wanted to do that.
Jami and Catherine are still trying to figure out what needs to be done.
I hope Jami doesn't get jealous.
I have visited America.
The team was terrible.
Why are we still talking about this?
All the signs are that she is getting better.
I have been to more than ten foreign countries so far.
I'd sleep better at night if we had locks on our doors.
Does Jack watch TV every day?
I'll try to pay what I owe by the end of the month.
I just want to be your friend, nothing more.
She's happy.
I'll treat you like an adult when you start acting like one.
I'd never ask you to do that.
Joe may be young, but he's very wise.
There's only one way to be sure.
Don't get too comfortable.
I bought a pair of boots.
Mary told me that she thought Adam was through doing that.
Jami told Julia that he thought John was engaged to Alice.
I wish that I were still living in Australia.
I wonder where Oscar went to college.
A dog ran about in the garden.
Oscar let me sit next to Monica.
Adam took off his glasses and wiped his eyes.
If she comes, I'll go too.
He is poor but is too proud to ask for help.
I was defending myself.
Harry said that he thought it could happen in Boston, too.
We are committed to our country's welfare.
He can't see the forest for the trees.
Jokes are no laughing matter.
Do you like silent movies?
That's all we needed!
Alex became very mad.
Like it or not, we have to attend that meeting.
Monica said she feels a lot better today.
Identify William.
I won't tolerate your mistakes again.
I share a house with two of my friends.
The earthâs climate is changing faster than at any other time in history.
We missed them.
Don't lose hope.
We need to go.
They hate us.
I want to do spring cleaning.
She never saw her mother again.
The sun is above me.
"Let's go see a movie tonight?" "I can't. I'm busy." "What about tomorrow night?" "I'm busy then, too."
I don't think that we're going to do that today.
It's just a simple cold.
I don't care what Charlie did.
He broke down completely on hearing of his daughter's death.
Let's settle accounts.
Alex is still in school, isn't he?
I know that Muhammad knew he had to do that today.
Do you like it here?
I think I might be able to find Oscar.
You weren't that great.
Even if you're married to a monster, murder is not the way to go.
Ask Joe and Lucy if they know how to do that.
This sentence is too long!
Do you know anything about your family?
I hope William hasn't already drunk all the milk.
I often receive letters from him.
I have to change a string on the guitar.
She said that she'll do that later.
Your injury will get worse unless you see a doctor.
Joe told everybody about what he did.
My sister doesn't wish to associate with them.
Adam should be back by October.
James and Margaret were in the room by themselves.
William doesn't think he's very good at French.
She does not smoke.
Both Tommy and Margaret decided to enter the contest.
Where are Oscar and Laur going?
Oliver spent his birthday in the hospital.
I saw you smile.
He started to sing.
When are you going on summer vacation?
I want to know why you're not going to do that.
I heard a noise up there.
I don't think Oscar has to do that by himself.
I don't think I'll have too much of a problem with that.
Alex is going to go to Boston on business next week.
Anna looked over her shoulder.
It takes will power to give up smoking.
I ran away.
How do you expect them to lift themselves out of poverty when no one will hire them?
A stranger spoke to me in the bus.
I could hear sirens in the distance.
James said that he thought he knew what Emma planned to do.
Oscar is the best man for the job.
Should I get her for you?
Thank you for your e-mail regarding the matter in question.
Which part of the word "no" do you not understand?
Alice wasn't at home when I went to visit her.
They seem to trust you.
Oscar and Carmen said they knew John wouldn't do that.
Jack is ready to help you.
I don't think anyone would agree with that statement.
Tell her what you told me.
We played chess not so much to enjoy the game as just to kill time.
Jack and Julia have decided to get married in October.
It's not possible to breathe here.
Muhammad won't permit you to do that anymore.
Joe went to Australia alone.
That looks like a gang sign.
Charlie said that he wished he hadn't eaten so much.
I don't think Jacob knows how much it'll cost to stay in Boston for a week.
William was the one who taught Eva how to do that.
Emma refused to accept the roses that William sent her.
I spent my vacation in Australia.
You were acting like a baby.
William is married to my sister.
There's just one problem. I can't find anybody to help me.
Muhammad said that he was fine.
We're eating dinner right now.
We each drank three cups of coffee.
It's mine now.
How did you know William was planning to do that?
I'm the owner.
I'd never be able to afford to buy a house on Park Street.
Harry had never played that game before.
How many times a month do you do that?
Don't buy those shoes.
You'll soon be able to swim.
You aren't really planning to go, are you?
I pulled myself together and started my work.
Harry said that Carmen was likely to be interested.
The death rate was high.
It's just a weird feeling.
Jami and Eva got married three months after they met.
I don't know whether Adam is having fun or not.
George doesn't know the difference between reality and imagination.
You should ask them yourself.
I assume you've heard about Oliver's promotion.
She starts her job at seven o'clock.
Lucy called me after Jacob called her.
The teacher caught Alex cheating on a test.
Did you even get to talk to Jacob?
I know an English teacher who comes from Canada.
I thought I was going to make a lot of money doing that.
I did know I was supposed to do that.
I took a lot of pictures last month when I was in Australia.
Since I can't be with you, I send you a kiss.
This coat is bigger.
The problem is the economy.
You could have been in very big trouble.
Alex and Carmen killed themselves last October.
Let's cooperate where we can, let's confront where we must.
Are Oscar and Valentina mad at us?
I think Jack can help you now.
Tommy wasn't the one who told me that I didn't need to do that.
If George comes, please tell me.
Anna said she felt the same way.
Harry said it's all right to do that now.
Alex sent his son to bed without dinner.
Charlie is the only person to survive the fire.
I think Jacob could go to Boston with you.
I'm quite happy about that now.
What time do you arrive home?
Has James promised to be there?
She says that she's just eaten.
Please tell me where you got this.
There was a large explosion in Boston last night.
I'll be waiting over there.
I intend to come.
It's a big company.
It looks like Alex isn't going to go to Boston with us.
We rode in an elevator.
Did William say that?
Why didn't somebody call us?
Harry said he thought that there was a chance that Eva would win.
It was huge.
When you're good enough to join the team, we'll let you join.
I'm on my way to pick her up.
Did you actually believe that?
Jack helped rescue Valentina.
It's a crazy idea.
I can't meet you.
Don't fail to lock the door.
James checked his text messages.
Adam wouldn't let Anna do that.
Up to that time, we were watching TV.
The answer should be no.
"How many times did he kiss you?" "Just once."
Charlie doesn't usually talk to me like that.
I doubt if Charlie will be the last one to do that.
Sorry, I've already forgotten your name.
They said they won't come to our party.
I forgot who said that.
I can run.
We're finally on the right track.
I took her arm.
I'll try my best to finish it in time.
William kissed Monica goodbye at the gate.
Do you think Jami and Julia were embarrassed?
You killed her.
Oliver said his schedule will probably change.
They said that they felt cheated.
Tommy and Mary said they're well.
Tommy is waiting for Carmen to tell him what to do.
Can you deal me in?
Do you often ride a motorcycle?
You're very efficient.
Oscar was there for me when I needed him.
It wouldn't hurt to tell me.
I've learnt nothing from the teacher.
Jami thinks that Laur won't be interested in doing that.
I knew that Muhammad would likely not need to do that again.
What time does the next train going to Tokyo leave?
Everybody fears that prison.
She jumped out of her seat.
She dropped her pencil.
Jack won't be able do that without someone's help.
You look like you've just seen a ghost.
Do Muhammad and Eva still think John did it?
We should have done that earlier.
What're your plans for this afternoon?
Do you want me to turn off the lights?
Jack is pretty good at this.
Let's not get up so early tomorrow morning.
The cause of the fire was unknown.
I thought that you used to be a teacher in Australia.
Oscar is going to regret doing that.
I wish I'd slept last night.
What time is the meeting?
She went to Chicago by bus.
Since today.
I assume that you know Harry.
"I can't find Joe." "Try ringing him."
He'll soon catch up with Harry.
When did it stop raining?
Where do the batteries go?
They fell into the difficult problems.
What makes you think Jacob won't know how to do that?
I can't believe you really want us to do this.
Olivia lost her life.
The secret of success lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from his angle as well as from your own.
I smelled it.
Adam said that he didn't think that Mary could've done that by herself.
She said that she couldn't recall.
Red wine does not go well with fish.
Oliver dreamed about doing that.
I got married again.
I'll be back by the end of the year.
I don't feel like talking about Muhammad today.
Please give me help in taking this down.
We assumed you were dead.
He was looked up to by all his friends.
But what if she says no?
Don't close the door!
Don't let him do it alone.
Adam likes it here.
Joe says Olivia lies a lot.
William and Olivia are both planning to be at your party.
I'm born in the U.S.S.R.
We need to be sure.
William and I want to do that now.
Her face was wet with tears.
Charlie didn't seem to understand the purpose of the project.
Harry made me a good offer on my car.
Alex thought Olivia was the weird one.
James didn't even write one letter to Carmen while he was away.
He hasn't the slightest suspicion.
Tommy didn't know who to ask.
The truth is quite complicated.
George got back home earlier than expected.
It is a super idea.
Is the house beautiful?
What kind of logic is this: if it is not yours, it must be mine?
Alex isn't the kind of person who'd say something like that.
There must be some reason for what he has done.
That's something I have to do by myself.
I didn't have a weapon.
Harry doesn't know a thing about me.
I told Oliver I didn't want to drive.
He said that he was really happy.
She said she isn't angry.
I wonder if we'll like doing that.
You should apply for that post.
We just found the murder weapon.
Should I call them?
Are you going to move in?
He met with an accident and broke some bones.
I think what you just told me isn't correct.
Do you like to wear jewelry?
He got a master's degree in law.
I'm seeing them tonight.
It was a problem, but not one we couldn't solve.
He told me he understood.
Jacob said Alice is upset.
I am to meet him at five at the station.
Tommy and Mary must've hit their heads.
You can only find this in LA and here.
That isn't a good enough reason.
I know that James didn't know that you couldn't do that.
Where is the nearest bus stop?
Have you been waiting long?
Muhammad's savings will soon run out.
Oscar didn't want to admit he had a drinking problem.
With his death, the oldest family in this village died out.
His car was blue and hers was red.
I know that Charlie is insane.
I know his address.
The book was new.
The new business was eating away his fortune.
Jack doesn't want to be found.
Should we tell Monica she doesn't need to do that?
I thought that you said that Adam should do that.
Oscar and I'll be traveling together.
I don't even know where to start looking.
Oscar and Mary didn't look like they were having any fun.
I'm afraid we can't rule out the possibility that she may have the disease.
James isn't as fast as I am.
Adam and Margaret have already finished, haven't they?
True love doesn't exist!
I proposed that she come with me.
Jami was attacked by a shark.
Where does this road lead?
He taught his children Russian.
I just don't want to talk about it anymore.
I don't like my mother-in-law.
Carmen told Joe she was going to Boston.
I wasn't very busy anyway.
This was recommended to me by Oliver.
Here's a towel you can use.
It's not at all easy.
I think that was a waste of effort.
What made you think so?
I plan on doing that tomorrow for the first time in three years.
You're done working, aren't you?
Are we going to help them?
She gave me good advice.
I know that Adam has to leave.
Charlie and Monica say they don't want to talk to you.
Alex and Alice say they wouldn't want to do that.
I can't understand her obsession with soccer.
I want you to find out about Joe.
Did you tell Valentina she's not allowed in this room?
What kind of music do you think Tommy and Catherine like?
James thinks that Monica probably hasn't done that yet.
I will be very careful.
Will Brazil win the 2014 World Cup?
Harry asked me to look for some rope.
William never thought Anna would hurt him.
Alice married one of her students.
Muhammad told me he didn't have to do that.
I didn't know Oliver at all.
James is in trouble, isn't he?
That's happened to a lot of us.
Your clothes always smell bad.
Are Tommy and Alice still French teachers?
We think you should take it.
As soon as he went out, it began to rain.
This child has the flu.
Muhammad is a very gentle person.
It's not important, things happen.
You're good at drawing.
What a beautiful garden they made!
They can't tie their shoes by themselves.
They look like they might be sick.
The bed at the hotel where I stayed was too soft.
Tommy is going to be in Boston all summer.
People don't like to swim against the tide.
We've heard this before.
He seems to have finished his work.
How do I turn this off?
It was at that very moment that the bomb went off.
She left her keys in the car.
No one realized that Harry and Olivia were in pain.
I'll tell you all about it tomorrow.
It's not like him to be late.
I heard James enter the room.
Jack was putting stuff in a box.
Why didn't you tell me first?
She says she won't study French.
Jack thinks that he could probably do that.
I read the book in my second year of high school.
Where did you miss your umbrella?
Adam told me that he thought that Anna was rude.
That dog jumped.
Why doesn't she look at me anymore?
Valentina said she was very upset.
Oliver said he hasn't decided what to do yet.
Jacob and Alice were both asleep at that time.
If it had not been for your aid, I would not have succeeded in my business.
I think that's the point.
Prove to me that you don't have a sister.
The trees will soon be bare.
George lost patience.
Are you going to see George again?
Oscar always had a smile on his face.
Harry said that it wasn't likely to happen.
I have to do a lot of things.
They eat shark.
Oscar regrets he couldn't go.
I think Jami is a few inches shorter than Julia.
Oscar died of cancer.
For Christmas, we will be in the mountains.
I hope that you'll accept my request.
George burned everything Catherine had given him.
Alex wasn't aware that Emma was married.
Remember last year.
I'll be there, so whatever it takes.
Eva said she thought Jami spoke French.
I looked up at the moon.
I feel comfortable in her company.
Charlie made it himself.
Charlie said Emma was the only one who got here on time today.
George has asked Olivia to marry him.
She said that's fine with her.
Alice said she thought I might have to do that soon.
I know Muhammad knew that I couldn't do that.
I can't help you because I am busy.
I know Alex might not do that.
Find out what Adam and Mary want.
Laur grabbed her purse.
You've never seen me do that, have you?
Tommy wasn't even scared.
Could I look at that one?
I let William kiss me yesterday.
We'll probably get married.
I'll take you wherever you want to go and buy you whatever your heart desires.
She said that she'd look at it.
We owe you one.
You're part of the family.
We did that last week.
Jack was beaten to death with a golf club.
A great number of books are published every year.
"Why are you always taking Lucy's side?" "I'm not taking anyone's side."
It looked yellow to me.
Jami spent the day with his daughter.
James didn't use to drink so much.
I want you to follow him.
Mary focused on her work.
Three of those children are from Boston.
George is very sure Susie needs to do that.
My brother is not satisfied with his new car.
Today she is sick.
Alex is obliged to do that.
I wonder whether Muhammad is right or not.
She knows that she can't be replaced.
Eva took a picture of herself and sent it to her boyfriend.
Forgive him if you can. He is not guilty.
I'm not hurting your animals.
You have to call Joe.
You could relax.
They were hoping they could do that.
I was thinking about the good old days.
She lost her hat, but soon found it.
Who told you that I was in Boston last weekend?
He looked around the house.
She was happy for some time.
Carmen bought herself a new computer.
Let's hope Jacob and Laur haven't made a mistake.
Tommy says he wants something to eat.
Charlie was in no hurry to do that.
Put it in words I can understand.
Jami usually wakes up every morning before his alarm clock goes off.
Is there a discount for students?
Why should I care where Jack is going?
She's smoking.
That's a tough offer to refuse.
I don't like his looks.
Saying you can't do the job because you're too busy is just a cop out.
Do you have to make a speech?
Charlie and Emma say that they never lock their door.
I've asked James why he was sad.
Harry doesn't have many friends here.
No matter how I try, I can't forget that kiss.
Mary is by far the best drama queen I have ever seen.
They sent up a balloon.
It should be like this.
Nice to meet you, Mrs Jones.
Does Alex look thirty to you?
Oscar said he's exhausted.
I've left my umbrella in the phone booth.
Charlie said that he didn't have to wait very long.
Alex said there was nobody in here.
It seems that your dog has taken quite a liking to James.
Neither Jack nor Catherine has a lot of free time.
Muhammad didn't say when he planned to do that.
I told Muhammad that I don't have time to do that.
We were going real fast.
Find Charlie and bring him home.
Oliver was a bad boy.
Charlie hasn't had a fight with anybody lately.
You thought Jacob did that on purpose, didn't you?
I love to see him smile.
I don't have time to relax.
She is two years older than you.
He told me that he wanted to practice his English with me.
What impressed you most?
I don't know when Adam will show up.
You weren't the one who actually did that, were you?
The wind has dropped.
I've gained weight again.
Charlie's car was stuck in the mud.
Somebody has left the window open.
You don't drink enough water.
Jacob and Alice tried to hide their fear.
I wish I were wrong.
He said he's not worried.
I think that Oscar will be here by 2:30.
Joe told Carmen that he didn't think John was nice.
You can do that, too, if you want to.
Do you really want to know where James is?
William said he wanted to tell you how to do that, but Julia told him not to.
James ate something.
Since when are you wearing contacts?
Carmen said she doesn't plan to do that here.
Adam said Lucy was the only one who did that.
William said that it wouldn't take much time to do that.
This book was first published in 1877.
I thought that Harry was too busy to help us.
You should've called the cops.
James is the only other person who should have done that.
Did you think that was fun?
He was not able to open the box.
Jack wanted to make a lot of money.
Didn't you know that Jacob and Lucy said they weren't going to do that?
We had so much fun together.
The library books were out of order.
Charlie walked Susie to the bus station.
My grandfather died when I was boy.
Oliver lied to the police about where he was at that time.
Adam hasn't mentioned you.
We know each other quite well.
She can say what she wants to say.
It's obvious that Jacob and Margaret like each other.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
She fell in love with her therapist.
George and Valentina are too young to go to the zoo by themselves.
Eva said she's been robbed before.
That's pretty typical.
Does George have a sense of humor?
Jacob should be able to tell us a little about Boston.
I've seen Joe in action.
Adam and Alice are finished, aren't they?
I didn't have to go with George.
There's no way Muhammad and Laur did that on their own.
You're the same age as me.
I'll stay home if it rains tomorrow.
I should have done that the way James told me to.
They say I stole someone's camera.
They know you were the one who visited Joe the night before he was killed.
I wasn't the one who opened the door.
Tommy parties too hard.
I didn't have a job at that time.
Can you leave my office, please?
Are you older than Adam?
Do you know how much these shoes cost?
Charlie is a violin teacher, isn't he?
You never told me why you didn't do that.
I've already said I don't know how one does it.
Have James call me.
We shouldn't let other people know we've done that.
Muhammad said that he hoped that Valentina won the race.
I don't live in that city.
William and Laur said that they weren't mad anymore.
George is working as fast as he can.
I know James doesn't know that he doesn't need to help us do that.
We need to find new people to work in the kitchen.
Please wish me luck.
I still have no idea why Jacob didn't win.
Jami seemed to be very happy.
I just found out Adam and Mary are dead.
I'm not at all sleepy.
Thanks for the food.
It doesn't fit well here.
I doubt if Oscar will do that again.
She introduced me to her father.
We could've helped them.
If you don't behave yourself, you won't get any dessert.
How did you all escape?
Nobody has heard anything from Oscar since he went to Boston.
He is wise in certain respects.
I knew he wasn't Jack.
They answer us whenever we ask them questions.
Adam and Monica said that they might possibly do that.
I knew Oscar didn't how long it was going to take to do that.
He's meeting with a Japanese girl.
She's right.
I don't know whether Alex is good at swimming or not.
Japanese cars are right hand drive.
It's in here somewhere.
I'm sure you understand why we have to do this.
I don't like talking about my feelings.
Oscar didn't have any privacy.
I don't think there is any excuse for William's behavior.
I already have one.
Carmen left.
Before I had eaten breakfast, I had run five miles.
I know some of Joe's friends.
I didn't know you were dating Charlie.
Joe wakes up early.
How long have you been worrying about that?
Charlie co-wrote these songs.
Let's think out another way.
Don't even bother coming.
Julia said she wasn't bored.
We can't keep this a secret forever.
Their expectations are very high.
I haven't noticed any difference.
Why are you so popular?
I'd better clean up now.
How long do you think it would take us to get to Boston by car?
Muhammad is always stubborn.
Who else knows your house is haunted?
I should get back home.
Emma said she'd like to know why Joe wanted to do that.
I don't think that you should be doing that now.
If anybody could do that, it would be Jami.
I was surprised that Alex was there this morning.
I enjoy working in a shop.
You don't understand.
I don't want to drink things tonight.
He is in a sense a representative of his company.
Tell Tommy I'll be there as soon as I can.
You have no clue on how disappointed I am!
James will do that as soon as possible.
George has mentioned you.
Please get away from me.
I've never seen you here before.
Oliver won't hug Emma anymore.
I thought Oliver could lend us some money.
He said he doesn't eat pork.
A known mistake is better than an unknown truth.
I haven't talked to Muhammad about that yet.
James has had many different jobs.
You need to wait for a while longer.
It is no use trying again.
Our house is in front of the train station.
Adam seems to be able to sense when someone is in trouble.
I wish I was as hungry as you.
How was it kept secret?
Could I talk to you for a second?
I'm particularly impressed that Muhammad could remember all of our names.
Just give me my gun.
Jami will try to do something about that.
That would be hilarious.
I should probably not tell Oliver that I can't do that.
I've made some mistakes.
Where did she get that coat?
I haven't met any of James's brothers.
You should enjoy the moment.
Didn't you know Tommy had a brother?
Charlie just got out of rehab.
Why do you want to kill me?
Do you think I didn't hear that?
We're friends.
I'm trying to help Catherine, but she won't let me.
Someone who knows French well must have written this.
This pair of shoes is a size larger.
Jack was surprised when Susie showed up at his party.
Joe was knocked out.
You're not that important.
You didn't seem surprised when Muhammad told me I didn't have to do that.
She died when she was thirty.
James sent flowers to Valentina.
I never get tired of it.
We're better off not running traffic lights.
Alex has been read his rights.
I don't need you to remind me of anything. I know what I'm supposed to do.
Why did you tell me Muhammad lives in Boston when he actually lives in Chicago?
Just try it out.
We're pleased with the decision.
I don't know her whereabouts.
Nothing is working.
Oscar has all sorts of problems.
Muhammad didn't mention anything about the party.
You must hurry.
William has enough time to do that if he really wants to.
They say that they want more than that.
I wonder what Harry will want to do.
Julia refused to do what I told her she had to do.
Jacob and Lucy told John that they didn't think Alice was correct.
They are having tea in the living room.
How about this for your room?
You've never been as busy as I am right now.
English is spoken around the world.
I can cook very well.
Harry said that Julia has never met John's parents.
He's very close to his family.
We'll eat at Susie's place this evening.
Jack can't ski.
George isn't used to speaking in public.
Tommy has a younger brother named John.
We're ready to put the boat in the water.
Alex might go to Australia next Monday.
I want to learn to dance like you.
Adam said he was ready to talk.
Don't let me catch you doing that.
Why didn't you go with them?
It only took you about three hours to do that, didn't it?
I'm sorry, but I didn't receive any milk at my house today.
I have to get through with the work by tomorrow.
I might not be in Australia next week.
Do you like my T-shirt?
Find out all you can about Alex's business.
I know you like to travel, Jacob.
Harry has been a very good customer.
He put his shoes on.
William and Eva are now cleaning up the area.
Oliver has already decided he's not going to walk home.
Oscar knows exactly what he has to do.
I didn't know that Harry said that he'd do that.
Do you plan to go overseas?
It was only a kiss on the cheek.
Jacob came on Monday and went back home the following day.
Tommy said that he wanted some money.
They did not notice the small differences.
The election campaign of 1880 was not exciting.
Oliver is going to be surprised if you don't do that.
Jami said he's grateful.
I need to ask you some more questions.
I didn't know that you three were friends.
I need a liver transplant.
Oliver and Eva never seem to have any money on them.
Oliver likes to hunt, doesn't he?
Our company has just launched a new product on the market.
William's parents think William is still too young to have a girlfriend.
We knew this was coming.
They're eating apples.
That won't make her happy.
Harry wasn't the one who gave Lucy that.
People fought over supplies.
He was walking slowly down the street.
Do you know when they will be back?
A dog is running in the park.
How have Tommy and Lucy changed?
I haven't heard from Jack in years.
Alex said that Valentina wasn't surprised.
You look good together.
Muhammad and Valentina agree, don't they?
Harry knew that he was safe.
I won't ever kiss James again.
It didn't seem real.
I don't think you need to tell Adam why you weren't here on Monday.
Smoking does damage your lungs.
William and Margaret had a nice time together.
You still look very tired.
Before I go to school, I take a shower.
Waiter, I need a spoon.
He moved to New York, where he looked for a job.
I never should've listened to you.
How about going for a swim?
It's time to carry out the plan.
If Oliver had not called me then, I might have killed myself.
Doing that will be very difficult.
Jacob and Eva said that they'd come back later.
I pretended I didn't know how to open the safe.
We'd like to talk to Harry.
Who do you think is most likely to win the race?
Harry is going to be furious, isn't he?
He was too tired to go any farther.
He got his eyes tested.
Don't trust people who praise you in your presence.
It's more difficult than what you think.
I know Harry knew that Alice was the one who had to do that.
Tommy and Alice said they've been robbed before.
What time do you usually have lunch?
I thought you said you liked William.
I took a taxi from the train station to the hotel.
Who am I supposed to help?
Jami already plans to leave early.
Jacob said that he wanted ice cream.
I never made such a promise.
The dog has destroyed my shoes.
We've got to keep getting better.
Don't talk to him while he's studying.
Lucy is very hard on herself.
Jack and Emma told me that they could help us.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
What Tommy and Julia had was special.
We have refused.
Recently, he's been drinking too much.
What would you suggest we eat?
I may be able to come to Australia next October.
Oliver and Lucy ended up not getting paid as much as they expected.
Everybody has to eat.
I have a license.
Charlie is very helpful.
Do you think that it would be fun to do that?
I can try to reason with William.
Where is the receipt that I need?
James will need both of them.
I wish that you'd stay in Australia a few more weeks.
I doubt Muhammad is still desperate to do that.
This is my sister. She is called Julia.
Adam said he was hoping that you could do that.
Did you notice that he left home?
They say there will be a general election this fall.
We shared the profit among us all.
Why do men get all the good jobs?
Do Harry and Susie have a secret?
Let me be honest with you.
I wouldn't accept that job.
Life cannot exist without water.
Catherine had her camera stolen.
Hi. If I'm not mistaken, you're our new neighbors, aren't you?
Maybe Oliver did that on purpose.
As strange as it may be, he met with somebody who is said to be dead.
I'm mature.
He refused to inform them.
How do you know so much about it?
I thought it would be better.
Oliver even worked as a taxi driver in Australia.
I have to fix it.
He warned us not to enter the room.
The noise didn't bother me.
You don't know what you want, do you?
It's Wednesday.
We listen to the radio.
We'll go talk to him.
You know I'm married, don't you?
They said that they're tired.
We finally arrived at the ski hill... the snow had turned into rain.
It's a lot easier to fall in love than to stay in love.
I found out we were all alike.
We are very interested.
I still have a few things I need to do.
Jack is determined not to make the same mistakes Anna did.
Don't forget to put a stamp on the letter.
There's nothing more important than friendship.
It's walking distance from here.
Jacob said you were coming by.
Is this interesting to translate?
I've learned so much.
We've worked hard.
Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
I didn't have time to eat breakfast this morning.
She worked hard, only to fail the examination.
He has never tasted alcohol.
They said they didn't like to do that.
Tickets are available online or at the door.
Alex and Eva told me that they thought John was bored.
Let's be honest!
Harry stood up and went to the window.
She is easily moved to emotion.
Call me when you get there, so I know that you're safe.
I'm a poet.
There's something we have to get straight.
Some animals eat their young.
Muhammad is a witness.
She blew out all eight of her birthday candles.
Your daughter's on drugs.
Does the government really care?
I know Adam liked to do that.
Muhammad and Julia had a lot of fun.
Muhammad said that I looked hurt.
I know your being here means a lot to Oliver.
Julia told Jami that she thought John was crazy.
What was Dan wearing?
I've never needed anybody.
I thought you knew.
Jacob wasn't there that night.
I think we should tell Olivia that she has to do that.
James burned his tongue on the hot cheese.
Oliver stepped aside, letting Emma pass.
Do I need to go on?
I reckon something scared him.
We took a walk in a beautiful green valley.
I still make many mistakes.
Jami got the part.
Charlie told me I shouldn't eat that.
No one knew Muhammad was in Boston.
Do you like adventure stories?
It just stopped working.
I want to do that, but I can't.
Oliver said that he'll help me get everything I need.
It's good that William hasn't done that yet.
Harry said Valentina is probably still weak.
Hey, where's Oscar?
Laur has already told Harry she doesn't know how to do that.
How long was your flight?
He hasn't come home yet, has he?
She lies!
I think Alex and Lucy are waiting for you on the porch.
Tommy doesn't know for certain when Eva will come.
Did they have it?
Jacob walked into his room and closed the door.
I don't want anyone to see us.
We have to know right away.
Harry forgot to lock the bathroom door.
He will follow William.
Charlie seems to be angry.
My heart is broken.
Does it snow much here in winter?
Anna is hard to reach, isn't she?
Nothing blew up!
I did that slowly.
These people are our guests.
Let's go back to the hotel.
You've got to do it now.
I want you to stay with her.
I told Jack that I never wanted to do that again.
I was hungry.
I must do that carefully.
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty or thirty-one days make up a month.
That was what I meant.
Charlie said he immediately called the police.
If we keep going this way, we'll hit the wall.
Water was coming out of the damaged pipe.
The question is how will we deal with this difficult situation.
I want to talk about what happened.
Muhammad is the son of Alice's cousin.
I can't keep up with you.
We were married five years ago today.
I'd be happy if you'd call me George.
What a stupid question!
She'd be forgiven if she did that.
William tried to help me, but I told him I didn't need his help.
Joe was happy that Laur did that for him.
The harbor can be blocked.
It's going to be hard to find someone to do that.
Do you think Oliver is still doing that?
What shall I put on over my sweater?
No one knows what happened.
Charlie cut his finger.
Don't give up on your dream.
Some think there are too many foreigners; I think there aren't enough.
Where's the fun in that?
We're not likely to see that happen.
Unfortunately the poet died in his youth.
Not everyone who lives here is rich.
Well, go faster.
I think George and Laur were impressed.
Is Olivia planning to do that by herself?
I want to go wherever you go.
Do what we tell you.
The enemy attacked the town.
It isn't safe for you to walk home alone.
I was next.
Oscar said Lucy is pretty good at cooking.
My father won't allow me to keep a dog.
Susie said she'd help Adam, too.
This kind of thing has never happened in Boston.
It's raining outside right now.
Whoa! I'm going to be a father!
Do you dream in French?
Tommy knows that better than anybody.
There's no reason for concern.
Joe and Monica told me they liked snow.
He's not thirsty.
Don't you want to come to Australia with me?
I think that Joe is a nice guy.
Do I look busy to you?
I thought so.
We are playing a game with our visitors.
I never met Harry.
Adam said Lucy was likely to be upset.
That's Charlie playing the piano.
Never doubt!
Susie thought she was the only one who knew how to do that.
Don't let anyone cheat you.
You ought to let Oscar know that you'll probably do that.
Her illness is not such as to cause anxiety.
Thanks for the support.
Harry said that Carmen might agree to do that.
Could you be a little more specific?
I'm really impressed.
I'll wait here till Muhammad comes back.
Can you fix me a reservation?
He kissed me softly on the lips.
Charlie studied French for a few years.
Short and sweet.
James gave Eva a sweater.
George and Laur told John that they thought Alice was upstairs.
Muhammad and Alice are in town.
Go get a beer.
This book was more interesting that I had expected.
You don't love Harry, do you?
William is running out of money.
We can't get a hold of her.
I'd like to live in Rome someday.
His long nose became at least two inches longer.
Don't forget to mail the letters.
What's written on the stone?
I wish Oscar had done that.
Charlie and I lie to each other all the time.
I heard Charlie talking on the phone.
Where does your grandmother live?
I don't think that Adam knows French at all.
Emma doesn't do her job very well.
I know that James knows what Mary did.
James wants to speak with you.
You depend on others' help too much.
Muhammad wanted to be friends with Susie.
Jacob didn't know he didn't have enough money.
Charlie said that Catherine thought John might want to eat with us.
He likes his new car.
How much does it cost to get in?
My heart is in pain.
You don't want to talk to me, do you?
They're talking to him.
Do Alex and Anna still think that's what we want to do?
Muhammad has just done that.
You cannot be too careful in choosing friends.
James is waiting for Julia to do that.
Anna didn't want to look, but she couldn't help herself.
Who else knows that I'm here?
His new car is a real beauty.
Let the devil take him!
Where are the cops?
They won't forget you.
Just tell Alex what you want him to do.
They failed in the examination.
What do you want me to tell you?
He made a speech in support of the plan.
Jack always makes a point of arriving at least five minutes ahead of time.
George is likely to want to stay until Monday.
She must've finished her work early.
What does this mean for William?
You probably think I'm stupid.
Hold on for your lives.
It will soon come out all right.
If it should rain tomorrow, we would go by bus.
I'd like to see it.
How can I contact you?
That won't make me happy.
Mr. Jackson may be our teacher next year.
William will wait as long as he has to.
Russians never smile.
Tommy asked why Olivia needed to do that.
Jacob and I often tell each other stories.
I am a slave to drink.
I didn't want to go, but I needed to.
I have no money with me now.
The company abandoned that project.
We're saving lives.
If Laur knew how to swim, she would go to the beach more often.
I never see that play without crying.
Lucy knew that Alex was upset with her.
To make a long story short, we married.
I don't know what Oscar and Lucy want to eat.
They're now home with their family.
Oliver definitely knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Where is the garbage area?
I was on the same bus as George.
I was thinking about it a few weeks ago.
Jack thinks Alice probably hasn't done that yet.
George doesn't seem to be as tense as Lucy seems to be.
James usually goes swimming before 2:30.
I don't think this is a good time to do this.
The poor are not those who have little but rather those who need much.
What's the largest city in Australia?
The temple is at the top of the hill.
He will be a good doctor.
"Would you mind taking me home?", she said.
Jack and Catherine said that they were embarrassed.
I'm never satisfied.
He suddenly cut into our conversation.
I can't read your mind.
Jack asked Valentina how much she had paid.
His annual income is more than $100,000.
He raised his hand.
I did that as quickly as I was able to.
Would you make room for me?
Oliver left to go to pick Mary up.
I live right around the corner.
I did some checking.
Jacob has already left for Boston.
Harry is shorter than me, isn't he?
I'll tell the truth.
Do William and Carmen want to see me?
Alice said she liked the idea.
As long as you live under my roof you will live by my rules.
You don't seem to like doing that.
He was kind enough to help me.
Jami is back at work.
Adam asked Monica why she was buying so much food.
What I am talking about right now is the deep love and respect I have for my husband.
I don't know who Oscar wants to go to Australia with.
You didn't say yes, did you?
May I see my girlfriend now?
Who else went to Australia with you?
You can think that if you want.
Muhammad and Julia don't know why John doesn't want them at his party.
She felt like taking a walk.
Make certain that he returned home safely.
William wants Laur to help John.
The loss must be made up for next month.
I'm going to be in Boston next week.
I think that Oscar will very likely win.
You can't fire me, I quit!
The tap was broken, so I wasn't able to use it.
Oscar painted the ceiling white.
William filed an access to information request.
It's actually not that big a deal.
She wakes him up every day at 6:30.
If Jack hadn't done that, someone else would've.
Has it already arrived to you?
I don't think that I could stand it.
I think Jacob will do what's right.
Alex won't likely be better at doing that than Catherine.
Anyway, you don't have to worry.
Why does Tommy want to do that today?
There are people who cannot see a pearl even when it says "I am a pearl, I'm a pearl."
Tommy has a history of alcohol and drug problems.
Olivia is still kind of young, isn't she?
I don't think Olivia will be doing that by herself.
I can't tell you exactly how long it will take.
William wondered what Catherine had been thinking about.
I don't want her in this room.
It is strange that she should do such a thing.
Adam said he didn't think that Olivia really had to do that.
Alex stabbed Emma while she was sleeping.
Jack told Lucy that it was wrong to lie.
William was angry.
I think Joe might be able to win.
Harry said you might be coming by.
You should have told your parents about it.
Give me this hat.
Oliver took out the rubbish.
Jami has strange ideas.
Jami said he'd assumed Susie would do that.
Adam was not happy.
It's going to be crowded everywhere.
That's why we didn't attack.
I told you to stop doing that.
This ad will end in ten seconds.
How did you know that Charlie and Anna were lying to you?
I'd do that if I had the chance to.
Are you sure you don't want to stay for dinner?
He introduced me to Sue.
What did you recommend?
"Whose keys are these?" "They are Julia's."
I sometimes pray in the meeting room.
May I talk to Adam, please?
The hotel I'm staying at is near the station.
He checked in at a good hotel.
Do you really think William was the first one to do that?
We're never going to make it on time.
Has a solution been found?
She said that she knew what to do.
Susie answered all the questions that Muhammad asked her.
We should have done this much sooner.
I don't think that Jack will agree.
Oliver misses you.
George and Eva said that they didn't mind.
I haven't yet had an appointment with this accountant.
We'll defeat them in the end.
I think William has started already.
I wonder whether I can learn how to do that in three hours.
She wished she had a decent job.
We can't kill him.
Oliver said he knew that he might not be required to do that anymore.
He went by the name of Johnny.
It was kind of crazy.
George realized that he'd made a mistake.
James is seeing someone else, isn't he?
That fire burned the entire town to ashes.
I understand you so much.
Muhammad said he knew that Catherine wouldn't cry.
Harry isn't very good at climbing trees.
Tommy and Monica say they don't think John ought to do that.
George says he doesn't have time to do that right now.
I have no intention of getting married.
There's no reason why you shouldn't do it.
I don't care whether we do that or not.
I didn't think Jacob and Anna were sleepy.
Oliver didn't have to help Alice.
I think that watching TV is a waste of time.
Jacob is probably going to be fine.
Adam doesn't want to hug Eva.
Muhammad said it was pretty easy to do that.
It's past the square.
I just finished reading this book right now.
What were Oliver and Laur fighting about?
It isn't up for discussion.
He doesn't have enough money to travel.
George is usually the first one to arrive.
He died previous to my arrival.
Are you still sore?
How do you know that Adam isn't a native speaker?
Jami and Eva met for dinner.
I'm looking forward to visiting Adam in Australia.
Can I get your opinion on something?
I can never get Joe to eat any vegetables.
Joe and Margaret aren't dead, are they?
You'd be grateful if you knew the whole truth.
Margaret asked Tommy many times to let her go home early, but he wouldn't let her.
We could not continue our journey for lack of money.
Do you help Charlie?
I'm sure there's a connection.
How much does Tommy earn a month?
She planted a palm tree.
Have you ever tried body painting?
I felt that William wasn't doing everything he should have been doing.
Oscar seems very scared.
The tickets are 20 yen each.
That wasn't what we expected.
She's attracted to her husband's best friend.
Do you think Jack and Olivia like doing that?
I get emotional.
I wonder why Oscar stayed in Boston.
This is very valuable.
He makes it a habit to wake up early.
Adam is Catherine's second cousin, isn't he?
Is the patient prepared for surgery?
Alex didn't tell the whole truth.
Jacob isn't as driven as he used to be.
Joe is almost three years older than Lucy.
She's a crazy witch.
Jami and I are soul mates.
I smell something here.
James must've been the one who did this.
I know Tommy is a really interesting guy.
Is he studying now?
Alex and Susie would've done that correctly the first time if John had helped them.
He is studying hard so that he may become a lawyer.
What exactly do you want me to say to Jacob?
James is going to need to do that sooner or later.
They said that they were very lucky.
Jack is back in bed.
William can buy that for you.
Please help!
I have to remember to tell Jami to do that.
She says she thinks we could do that.
Never trust anybody.
I don't want Charlie to know that I got married.
Charlie bought a pizza and took it over to Alice's.
I don't feel like playing golf.
That'll cost us a lot of money.
The American public deserves better.
Do you have any idea what Jack wants?
Oscar and Margaret aren't as lazy as you think they are.
How does Oliver plan to pay for this?
Oscar is unlikely to be here on time.
James and Lucy said they were glad that John did that.
They're asleep in their beds.
Perhaps Tommy can borrow some money from Carmen.
There's nobody inside.
I'm pretty sure that Jacob and Emma are thirsty.
Don't buy it.
William said he'd like to keep working here.
I'm going to be here for three more weeks.
I know that you don't like being kissed.
I didn't know anyone could move that fast.
If you had been a little more patient, you would have succeeded.
Each morning we are born again. What we do today is what matters most.
I wasn't able to do anything I wanted to do.
I'll let you go home as soon as you finish doing what you're doing.
He is suffering from a bad cold in the nose.
It'll be fine, don't be afraid!
It seems to me that he likes music.
They won't be happy until we're all dead.
Alex and Lucy climbed the mountain in the rain.
I know you miss your friends.
George hasn't taken his pills.
I'm a wreck.
Adam isn't a drug dealer.
Did Jack know that Emma was planning to do that?
James filled the bottle with water.
Change the channel!
I'll consider your suggestion.
Tommy asked if it would be safe if he did that.
With kind regards to you all.
Once I had the chance to visit Paris.
I share your grief.
I went to my bedroom and followed his advice.
William never wanted to teach French.
She did not find it funny.
He doesn't shave his legs.
I hope he knows what he is doing.
You drink water.
She forgot to stop next to my house.
Joe talks quite a lot, doesn't he?
They said they liked me.
I'm Charlie's older sister.
Always carry some cash.
This is the kind of music that I like to listen to.
I had an inspiration.
I can't make it there in time.
I think parents should sing with their children more often than most parents do.
I don't think that Charlie is as stubborn as you think he is.
He likes the music.
According to Charlie, Susie is sick.
Let Oliver take a look at it.
Julia gave the same answer she always does.
I needed this.
Alex could die.
There is a little chill in the air.
Are James and Anna afraid of this?
I'd never do anything that stupid.
Dr. Jackson has many patients.
Do you still drink milk?
I've got Jack in my office.
Eva is my type of woman.
It's quite possible.
They looked like they were determined.
I can't concentrate on my work.
I heard that Adam went fishing yesterday.
Did you see anyone at the mall?
He is no match for me in tennis.
Oliver spent all the money he had to buy Eva a Christmas present.
Oscar was a member of our group.
Yes, the apple is red.
Unfortunately, that's correct.
Neither Harry nor Mary has given me anything.
Tell a beautiful story to my two young friends.
All I ever wanted was to just be left alone.
Oscar has begun to learn French.
You aren't welcome here.
Tommy said I should have stayed in Boston for a few more days.
I thought that I was the only one here who could speak French.
I didn't know who Muhammad was at first.
Eva said that she would do it.
William seems to be having trouble speaking.
I was with him last night.
Jacob and Monica both know that that's not likely to happen.
I go into the store.
Does your dog know any tricks?
I wish my parents would let me do that.
Adam said that he'd look at it.
Jacob and Eva say they'll answer that question later.
William said I should've left earlier.
He left the window as it was, open.
Jack isn't so well-mannered.
She told me she'd buy it.
I went to bed at one o'clock.
Tommy knew that he should study French.
I might not be allowed to do that.
Jami showed no emotion.
George has a job as a taxi driver.
I'm happy Alex and Valentina are telling the truth.
I don't like chess.
Both my mother and I can cook fairly well.
Harry explained his reasons clearly.
I should've given Jack more time.
My passport has been stolen.
I like him better this way.
How much money do you spend on clothing every year?
Watch where you're going.
May I come to see you this afternoon?
I'm not about to stop.
I didn't think James would notice.
James hoped the doctors would tell him he didn't need surgery.
Alex is still on probation, isn't he?
I eat my breakfast at seven o'clock.
Don't rely on others.
They said we could borrow their car.
Harry said that he plans on staying in Australia.
I'm supposed to see James.
He knows how to advise people.
He is still not old enough to go there all alone.
You'll have no problem with this.
It isn't a good car, but it's a car.
She couldn't ask for anything more.
That means we can change.
I thought that you said you were sick of peanut butter.
You shouldn't have written that.
You're a very pretty girl.
Is anybody else in the house?
How often do you hear from Jami?
It has been two years since I studied medicine.
I won't have to leave work early.
Our team is likely to win the game.
Someone stole my bike.
Emma told me she didn't love her husband anymore.
Jami had a little too much.
I'll do the shopping for you.
These pictures were taken by Joe.
We're not going to give Adam the money he asked for.
If you were a spy trying to pass as a native speaker and said it that way, you'd likely get caught.
It runs in the family.
I know that Tommy knows that Catherine isn't supposed to do that.
James fell asleep on guard duty.
I knew that Adam would be fired for doing that.
George thinks you'll enjoy this.
My youngest daughter is three years old.
Adam will keep doing that if he wants to.
You'll get there on time if you make the train.
He will regret his own words.
I didn't know that you didn't like Chinese food.
I don't really care how George does that.
In spite of the teacher's warning, the lazy boy comes late as often as not.
I'd like to travel first-class.
What didn't you tell us you didn't want to be here?
Joe, Margaret, John and Alice are all going to be there.
My friend is looking for a new girlfriend.
Why didn't Jack try to call Carmen?
What did you have to do with it?
I thought you'd be thirsty.
He gave up trying, when he might have succeeded.
I've already told Adam how to do that.
I'm pretty angry.
Oliver had reason to be concerned.
You have my word.
I usually sleep with the lights on.
Lucy said there wasn't anything she could do to help.
You were doing this before.
You don't get out much, do you?
We never really wanted to live in Boston.
How long did Tommy stay in Boston?
It would be nice if you could make me something to eat.
I've gotten used to that.
I don't think that you need to tell James you're planning on doing that.
William has left, but he'll be back.
Alex told me he and Julia were planning on going to the beach this coming weekend.
You have a spider on the ceiling!
Jami is in bad shape.
She said she wasn't sick.
I'm already a senior citizen.
James didn't have enough money to buy what he had to buy.
He said that he was tired and that is why he'd like to go home earlier.
We have to evacuate immediately.
I have them on the line.
James was there for me when I really needed him.
Charlie is likely to still be safe.
They need our support.
I'm used to losing.
Would you mind turning down the radio?
Julia isn't doing the best she can.
Art makes me happy.
I just want you to know I'm sorry.
They felt that they needed to do something.
Alex is in the hospital waiting room.
It seemed that William and Anna were depressed.
You are worthy.
I'd like to wash up before we eat.
She ended up going by herself.
Adam and Carmen were the first ones to volunteer to do that.
I'm the one who knows what has to be done.
We can't disappoint him!
What's going on here?
Tommy and Eva say you talked them into it.
The money will carry us for about a month.
How does it feel to be Mrs. Alex Jackson?
I can't give that up.
Empty the car so we can use it.
I think that William wants to go to bed.
I remember reading the book.
Alex never drinks wine.
Ken runs faster than you.
I don't know whether you'd remember Oscar or not.
Adam didn't think too hard about this one.
She told me she wanted to go.
Wake up Charlie.
What are you running away from?
Does George work?
Harry wondered if Anna would like the gift he bought her.
This is going to hurt a bit.
Don't mention this to anyone.
Joe says he's considering getting a dog.
I'm playing a game online.
I've heard of worse things.
I wonder whether Alex and Mary are still alone.
These two plans are alternative.
William thought that he might not need to do that.
It's quite possible that Alex did that.
Didn't I say I'd be back?
William and Susie say that they never cried.
Muhammad thinks Margaret knows what to do.
He played piano by ear.
That's my younger sister's photograph.
Joe is unable to decide which shirt he should wear.
Please tell me about it tomorrow.
The girl who lives next door is very pretty.
Do you think you'll need that?
Maybe we could meet up after school.
Anna told me that she was tense.
Emma was drunk last night when I saw her.
This is not my day.
The sun was shining all around.
Let me show you my new house.
Jami spent the whole morning with Catherine.
What're you doing to her?
Well, what can you say?
Harry and Monica flew to Boston today.
Muhammad and Catherine aren't worried about it.
The worst comes afterwards.
I don't yet know whether Adam will go with me tomorrow or not.
Jami seems to be having a lot of fun.
Muhammad has been here for at least a year.
William doesn't want Julia to see his painting until it's done.
I don't think that Tommy knows the details.
The last thing I want to do is hurt you.
Julia claimed she didn't do that.
It would've been crazy to do that.
I should stop doing that.
Where did Carmen buy her wedding dress?
You look very beautiful.
James was alone on the island.
I can't wait to get my driver's license.
Can I speak to you for a moment please?
Oliver has gone for good.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
I wish Jacob had known that.
Shouldn't we be talking about what happened?
What'll we do next?
She opened her eyes wide.
Aren't you willing to help?
George reached for the check.
One can gain a greater understanding of one's own language through learning another.
Mom did not mention it.
Have you ever been arrested for drunk driving?
I am!
Harry told me he thought that Olivia was in Boston.
After lunch today, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
Just missed.
It probably won't be interesting to do that.
Both injuries aren't considered serious.
I know that Muhammad will be home on Monday.
Muhammad is almost ready to start.
I feel very angry.
She went out of the room in anger.
Muhammad is an amazing actor.
I don't think Harry is too old for me.
Look me in the eyes and tell me you didn't do it.
Please keep in touch.
Tommy and Olivia both swear they're innocent.
We waited for three hours.
I didn't know that you could drive.
Harry knows what he did was a mistake.
I wonder where Jack and Valentina are from.
My father has been in hospital for two months.
Muhammad went to bed very late last night, so don't wake him up yet.
You simply don't understand.
Read over your paper before you hand it in.
My wife and I sometimes go to eat Chinese.
Of course, I'll marry you.
I can't even wash my face.
I knew you'd quit.
I don't know what's gotten into Tommy.
Why aren't you listening?
Joe is supposed to be helping us.
Alex said that he heard someone snoring.
I'm not sure Jami would want me to give you that.
Make sure that Alex does that by himself.
Flowers attract bees.
Our confidence in him is gone.
She was happy because she passed the exam.
This is a pretty stupid question.
Now stop that.
Jack and Alice aren't quite sure what to make of this.
I think that William is determined to do that.
Take the right road.
Oscar found God in prison.
On the hunt?
Who's your favorite fashion model?
Lucy was very good at doing that when she was young.
Oscar said that Emma wasn't the one responsible for what happened.
Jack's wife had a baby girl yesterday.
I think that's part of the problem.
You seem disappointed.
When are you going to tell Oscar?
Laur tied the rope around her waist.
He said he felt a bit tired.
They promised me that they'd clean my room.
They were really cold.
Monday follows Sunday.
Pour me a glass of wine.
James can leave if he wants to.
I know you won't have time to do that until next Monday.
Eva is in the bathroom, fixing her hair.
I need to talk to you about an urgent matter.
What will I find in the box?
We have a slight problem.
Charlie wrote me about that.
Here's the best part.
Tommy plans on doing that in the near future.
She said that she had a contract.
Let me know when you're ready!
I think she was wrong in regard to that.
The government makes us pay tax.
The salad contained marijuana and then he realized he loved his new job.
I'm preparing breakfast.
I am sorry that I have not written to you for such a long time.
I've only been here for a day and I already want to leave.
William has a new girlfriend already.
They're tears of joy.
Thank you for showing me the way.
He told me he was going to do that.
I rejected their offer.
Alex dropped his books.
They look as if they're in pain.
I don't think George did it.
Is this the best you can do?
What the flip!
Jack wouldn't allow Lucy to see his passport photo.
I'm gonna break your face, you piece of shit.
Adam asked Eva to tell John why she did that.
Valentina has been studying hard, hasn't she?
I told Muhammad that I was interested in buying one of his paintings.
What I'll do is: I'll clean the room.
I learned to read in school.
I've been living in Australia for three years.
You must do the work, even if you do not like it.
You will have nothing to drink but water.
How often do you give blood?
I didn't know you knew Adam.
How's the blue plate?
I've told you over and over again not to do that.
The breakfast cafe will kill me sooner than later.
Oscar will be arriving here soon from Australia.
I don't think they'll permit Jacob to do that.
Oliver and Julia said they weren't in the mood to do that today.
I really don't want to get any first-degree burns.
I didn't know William would be nervous.
I know that Adam has done that.
They had trouble finding their keys.
Jack takes his coffee black.
Oliver said that he wished that he hadn't forgotten to do his homework.
Don't leave the bedroom window open.
Harry says he isn't yet sure what the problem is.
Did William and Olivia both have to do that?
Was Charlie getting under your skin?
I can't imagine what that would be like.
I don't know exactly when he will arrive.
I don't think that Jack knows why Emma doesn't like living in Boston.
That happens to all of us.
It is high time you went to bed.
I had everything to be happy.
Adam could likely talk Monica out of doing that.
We shouldn't stand in Jack's way.
Don't you want to talk about what happened yesterday?
She believes it.
Tell Charlie I'm not interested in the car he's trying to sell.
How about a hug?
Anyway, you're my friend.
Where is everybody now?
Monica didn't finish the job we asked her to do.
Harry waited half an hour and then left.
Won't you look in on us?
Where did you say Oscar and Carmen were staying?
Harry's not fat.
I guess you've got me there.
What time will the flight arrive in Boston?
I was not sure what to do.
I give Jack the apple.
Olivia says she's not going to do that.
Sometimes I wonder what you're thinking.
This might be it.
Monica hanged herself in jail.
He's the boss.
Oscar is very good at cooking.
It wasn't necessary for you to see him to the door.
You're off the hook this time.
I rely on Alex.
Muhammad thought something bad would happen.
He was a tall, thin man.
He was granted permission to leave early.
Those who choose not to read have no advantage over those who can't read.
Muhammad and Lucy both plan to do that.
Shut up and clean your room!
What happened in here?
They may do that on their own.
Main Street was blocked off all morning for the parade.
I knew that I shouldn't waste my time trying to convince Alex to do that.
There are fifty states in the union.
Valentina swore she wouldn't do that again.
He kicked the dog which ran at him.
Jack never seems to have any free time.
I know Jami is a gun owner.
This mountain is among the highest in the world.
Jacob is looking for a man named John Jackson.
Children whose parents are rich do not know how to use money.
Jami realized you didn't need to do that.
I'm very greedy.
I'm often wrong.
My daughter drew me a picture.
âI am sorry, but I never apologize.
Obviously, Oscar hasn't told anyone about us yet.
They kept themselves busy.
I think we'd better take a break.
Hawaii is a popular tourist resort.
You should have told Oliver that he wasn't supposed to do that.
Please say it in French.
People are counting on us.
Do you think Tommy is responsible for what happened?
We can rest after lunch.
I'm sorry I couldn't write to you sooner.
I'm going to go to the airport.
You're the only person I'd consider giving this to.
What do they call you?
I've got to stay a little longer.
You're not the only one who has had problems with Jack.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
If you keep on drinking like that, you'll be drunk very soon.
They thought that they could win.
James doesn't have a job right now.
Do you like dancing?
There's no one here to help us fix the problem.
Jacob thinks that Alice is over forty.
Jack and Olivia have told me that they have to do that.
We must take his youth into account.
Alex was sitting at his desk.
Go there now.
Can we afford to take the chance?
You must study hard while young.
Jack stood as I approached.
Sometimes telling the truth hurts.
I hear that you're very good at what you do.
Be sure to get a receipt.
Jacob admitted that he stole Julia's jewelry.
What's your two cents?
James ate Anna's sandwich.
Could you mind my bag for a moment while I go to the toilet?
I remember your father.
If you're going to lie, you need a good memory.
Who is that man over there?
I know that you must have a lot of questions.
Enjoy your retirement.
Don't do anything embarrassing.
We make sake from rice.
Is he busy?
Jami speaks very highly of you.
It's way too heavy.
He's a lovely young man.
If I were to live abroad, I would live in Britain.
Adam lives near me.
I'm a bit lazy.
George and Susie still haven't done what we asked them to do.
I wonder whether Tommy would help me with my homework.
Here's the file.
Muhammad and Monica didn't regret their decision.
Harry seems to be in a hurry to do that.
Adam and Olivia were both laughing.
Don't talk in a loud voice here.
Everybody's on edge around the office.
When the visitor entered the room, we stood to greet him.
I wouldn't have recognized Jack if he hadn't been with Olivia.
The story has in it something of the element of tragedy.
How are your children?
Oscar tied Laur to the chair.
It's in front of a restaurant on 42nd street.
He is thinking of going to sea.
Jacob has neither a cat nor a dog.
Summer is the season I like best.
Would nine o'clock be convenient for Alex?
No one's buying it.
Tommy and Carmen won't likely try to do that on their own.
I told Oscar the truth.
Only a free people can be happy.
Oliver wished it would last forever.
Jacob can barely keep it together.
He went back into his room.
Alex thinks it'll be fine.
They said that they left their keys at home.
They said they were hoping to see you.
I think that Joe will probably cry.
Oscar is likely to be awake now.
Tommy says he plans on being in Boston next weekend.
I thought that George would be nervous, but he was very relaxed.
Maybe they can help us find a cure.
They took everything with them.
I thought that you moved to Boston.
When one door closes, open another one.
She says she wants more than that.
How do you know this machine is really safe to use?
I also don't think that Adam has to do that.
What can you tell us about this?
He remained in his room all day.
I'm doing this job to help a friend.
Joe won't get my vote.
The results aren't out yet.
Joe has spoken to me.
Jack and Margaret said they were really lucky.
This could be your big moment.
John will clean the potatoes.
It doesn't seem fair not to pay George the same as we're paying Carmen.
Joe might be on to something.
Susie told Jami she could probably do that by herself.
Where do you think William and Catherine are going to do that?
He did it, didn't he?
We're still too young.
Tommy is average height.
Do you like modern music?
William wondered why Alice was so excited.
I should've been the one to tell Jacob about what happened to Julia.
I don't doubt William has done that.
Perhaps Jami should've done that by himself.
We will have brought you to the hospital afterwards.
You shouldn't have to pay that much to buy one of those.
We can always ask Charlie for help.
He got up late and was late for school.
She plays tennis daily.
George couldn't help but wonder if it was a dream.
I wonder what William and Olivia need to do.
Does that really happen?
Why didn't you talk to Charlie?
That's never gonna happen again, right?
Alex lives in the worst part of town.
My father knows your mother very well.
The noise kept me awake.
I thought that the police were looking for George.
Then we went to the theater.
He was angry with his daughter.
I'm all alone right now.
Jacob is living in an apartment.
I might go running with Joe this afternoon.
Oliver ate a turkey sandwich and drank a glass of orange juice.
It won't be long before they get married.
I had a white dress made by my mother.
What did Adam tell you he was supposed to do?
I'll tell Oscar that you were here.
I want to move somewhere where the rent isn't so high.
I thought Charlie wasn't mad at you anymore.
William and Anna both wanted to go.
I don't understand the meaning of this phrase.
She locked her bike to a tree.
Lucy is still staring at me, isn't she?
"Your skin looks nice." "Oh? That's the first time anyone has told me that!"
He left by himself.
Did they ever find him?
Welcome to China!
Would you like me to wrap it for you?
"How long have you been in Australia for?" "3 years"
I thought that it wouldn't rain today.
All the students of the university have access to the university library.
I just got by on the test.
What Jacob really wanted was a new car.
You shouldn't eat here.
Could you solve the problem?
Button it!
Order me another one.
Muhammad seems to be trying to impress the new manager.
We don't have to go anywhere fancy. Maybe we could just grab something at Jami's Restaurant.
William quietly entered the room.
Oscar is still not safe.
Joe knew that Eva told everyone she was going to go to Australia.
Is life here hard?
Muhammad must've traveled a lot when he was younger.
I'm not sure if there was anything in the box or not.
What a man!
I wasn't really interested.
I don't think that Tommy can hear Laur.
Margaret is coming back, isn't she?
I didn't think Jacob would ever forget you.
She lost her temper with me when I broke the cup.
I hope you get a chance to go to Boston.
She handed him the key.
Here's a list of our demands.
William didn't tell Alice the truth.
Day after day I write to her.
We used to live in Boston.
I just did what they told me to do.
I can't precisely tell you how long that will continue.
You've never forgotten to send your mother a birthday present.
I thought that Muhammad wouldn't come.
Well, what did you expect?
He was big and handsome.
George doesn't want anybody to know that he's going to Australia.
I told Charlie that I wasn't interested in working for him.
She admitted that she was very tired.
All Tommy and Eva do nowadays is study.
Oliver will tell you what you need to know.
Tommy and Carmen are aware of what's going on.
Joe told me he thought this was a good idea.
Charlie was the one who made that decision.
Promise me you won't do that.
I'll need both of them.
I can't remember what Harry told me I needed to do.
Was it you who told Joe he has to do that?
I went to college in Australia.
Jack decided to give Mary a second chance.
Jacob finally went to Boston last summer.
Alex left the water running.
Is this really happening to me?
James and Monica did everything they could to stop John from doing that.
I hope Joe doesn't have to do that.
Let's definitely do that.
Can you write a letter in English?
Adam knows why Julia studied French.
Do you think George would go to Boston with me if I asked him to?
I'm not sure I really want to do this.
Our boss organized today's clean-up.
Hollywood isn't what it used to be.
What's happening tonight?
I'm pretty uncomfortable right now.
When I first met Susie, I didn't know that she was rich.
That possibility had never even occurred to me.
Perhaps Jack and Laur should travel together.
I know that Jack knows Eva wants to do that.
She laughed at my jokes.
Alex always leaves for school too late.
Orange is Joe's favorite color.
Listen, we have a problem.
He likes his coffee strong.
Do you speak Russian?
You've got to see her.
Perhaps it's real.
I found the money that Jacob had lost.
I sure hope that's not true.
Joe goes to school on foot.
Alice may possibly come.
Her biggest interest is strength training.
Will Jacob ever do that?
You collected coffee cups, didn't you?
Has Charlie given the go-ahead?
I don't care what we do.
I think that Adam and Catherine are dating.
I'll have to pay for it.
Peter doesn't need to attend the meeting.
Adam, get up!
He didn't do anything except read the newspaper.
Joe has decided to become a cook.
It is ten years since I left college.
That remains a big problem.
How long do you think it's going to take you to come up with a solution?
James is very curious about that.
Oliver knows he shouldn't be doing that now.
We hope that you won't do that.
It will shortly stop raining.
I didn't know how to tell him how much I loved him.
May I take off my coat?
I meet her on occasion at a beauty shop.
I don't hate this.
I like them.
It was because he was ill that he decided to return home.
It might take years.
Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a wonderful stroke of luck.
Alex doesn't want Alice to go anywhere without him.
Adam saw the bigger picture.
Valentina told me that she spoke French.
I think that Jami is too young to retire.
I don't think I'll be the first one to do that.
Why don't you all come with me?
Muhammad and Alice know they need help.
Jack isn't going to try to win.
It's five till four.
I had been in the army for a month when the war ended.
That's going to take a lot time.
I don't go swimming as often as I'd like to.
I know Jack didn't want be the next one to do that.
Do you know why I call you Jack?
I can be your best friend.
George and Monica don't know what they ought to do.
When was the last time Adam drove a truck?
You seem to be in pain.
They decided to quit their jobs.
Maybe that'll tell us something.
Linda hasn't arrived yet.
If it rains the day after tomorrow, I will stay at home.
Mary raised the three children by herself.
I want him to see this.
Short hair really suits her.
Our guests will arrive in a few minutes.
She says she isn't giving up.
He only does that when he's angry.
They couldn't buy everything they needed.
"What do you want?" "I want meat."
Did you learn to speak French when you were a child?
Instructions will be provided.
Oscar didn't want to die.
You're cheating on me, aren't you?
He understood and remembered easily everything that was taught to him; his teachers were very happy about it.
James said Margaret hardly ever does that.
I'm pleased you still remember.
I play bass in a jazz band.
Alex likes them.
Tommy is very special.
Alex and Margaret are considering that.
Call my wife.
I can't praise him enough.
Tell me why you didn't ask them.
It's not nice to make fun of others.
I'm not the only one here who thinks Oliver isn't a nice guy.
I know that you're going to do very well.
I'm sorry I called you names.
Why is it important to eat healthy food?
We did it with the greatest pleasure.
Some were injured and others were killed in the accident.
Jami has brought presents for us.
We can get started right away.
I think Susie wants to kill herself.
George was glad Carmen didn't do that for him.
Would it be all right if I visited you today?
They are watching what's happening closely.
William has a ticket.
Adam and Susie are now able to do that by themselves.
I'm saying I'm not sure.
Adam has spent time in prison.
I thought Oliver understood.
Do you enjoy dancing?
Adam said he wasn't willing to take that risk.
Alex said that I should've stayed in Boston for another week or so.
Don't you feel important?
Jami asked me where I was from.
It won't be as had to do that as you think.
She loved me in the same way that I loved her.
A big day awaits us.
Don't expect me if it's raining.
I'm not going to be able to do that alone.
Jack was the only boy Emma had really ever talked to.
Jami asked Mary not to do that here.
I am still a bit sore after my operation.
That will be funny.
You admitted that you were wrong.
Who hit the home run?
How tough was the test?
She is on the radio.
I have to leave again.
Can I wear your clothes?
William doesn't have a bike.
He took it as a personal attack this time
You're winning, aren't you?
There was nothing I could do to help.
Jami would have won the race if he'd run just a little bit faster.
William doesn't know whether I have to do that or not.
You like ugly people.
Everyone but me laughed.
Do you really think this is a good idea?
George knows that you know.
George can speak French as well.
He mentioned your name to me.
Where's my invite?
I wonder if this is really worth doing.
James said he thought Lucy wasn't happy.
George showed up late to class.
You need to get permission from Charlie.
It won't just happen overnight.
It can't happen.
How often does Harry go to Boston?
I didn't even ask him what his name was.
Can you teach me how to fly?
You may not agree with him, but at least he stands up for what he believes in.
How do you eat like that and keep your figure?
We ran as fast as we could.
James doesn't know whether the concert went well or not.
I knew that Muhammad didn't do that very often.
William doesn't do that well enough.
What's your book about?
I'm not Jacob's girlfriend.
Let's talk about your job.
You may have to do that by yourself.
George looks like he's sad.
I think Jacob doesn't want to tell us the truth.
I don't think that I'll allow Tommy to do that by himself.
I think that Jami will likely be home on Monday.
Did you go to a concert in Germany?
Jacob wasn't embarrassed, but Mary was.
He needs a cup of sugar.
He says he does that a lot.
I think it's unlikely that Alex will come to the party alone.
I wonder if James was the one who left that there.
I didn't have anything planned for today.
I rarely get out on weekends.
What's that building over there?
Jacob assumed everyone knew that he'd spent time in prison.
I grew up on a farm not too far from Boston.
She showed him the photo.
Tommy needs to know that we're here.
Alex doesn't like to discuss his work.
How so?
I think that that's the reason why Jack is doing that.
And if he keeps messing with me I'll cut his head off!
In the absence of firm evidence the prisoner was set free.
There were many things that I didn't like about that movie.
Jami wanted me to let you know when Emma will be arriving.
We talked to everyone.
Muhammad didn't want to go to the movies.
Alex never was neat.
Adam realized that he shouldn't do that.
Can you show me the list of prices?
Where did she put the newspaper?
I can see why Jami likes having you around.
Who would have thought this would happen?
Is that illegal?
This is also rather short.
We didn't know which bus we should take.
It was too late for you to say no, wasn't it?
The children soon became attached to their new teacher.
It's Germany's highest mountain.
The big white dog looks at that cat.
I didn't intend to hurt Jack's feelings.
William isn't feeling at all well.
Monica wasn't told she shouldn't do that.
The dog was run over by a car.
Every law has its exception.
It isn't quite dark yet.
I may have to fire Joe.
You know something you haven't told us, don't you?
I think William and Eva both have lied to us.
Catherine told me that she didn't love Charlie anymore.
Tommy plans to go, too.
Julia wants her next house to have an open plan kitchen.
If you don't do that, it won't get done.
Why is Oscar hiding from me?
Alex tried to fire his gun, but nothing happened.
It's hurting our children.
I speak French fairly well, but not as well as I speak English.
Harry agreed to Julia's plan.
It was cheaper than I had thought it would be.
You think you're so tough. You wouldn't last a minute in my neighborhood.
It'll take time.
I've already read some of what you wrote.
He is believed to have passed the examination.
Please listen!
It is hard to be successful at both study and club activities.
Emma is a stubborn person, isn't she?
You're both insane.
William was very convincing, wasn't he?
They don't really believe that nonsense, do they?
Adam rushed back inside.
It's my favorite character.
It's odd that there should be a light on in the office at this hour.
I can't deny this.
I don't know whether it's true or not.
Why shouldn't I stay in Boston?
I know James is afraid he'll get lost.
Be right there.
Let's go to Australia next month.
I know who the thief is.
Adam thinks Margaret won't be late.
He's been taught to accept things as they are.
I'm not planning to stay in Australia very long.
I'm having a really hard time getting to sleep at night.
Stay away from that guy.
I know you feel helpless.
How am I supposed to use this?
George and Olivia are pretty proud of that.
Jack was lame.
I guess it's decided.
What made you say such a stupid thing as that?
She told us the road was closed.
If you want, I will come back here.
Muhammad didn't want that.
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed.
I knew Muhammad would regret doing that.
I knew that Charlie wouldn't lie to us.
Julia hates secrets.
The only person Oscar ever talks to is Eva.
Let's not wait for George.
It's not without risks.
I can't explain the difference between the two.
I'll do everything for you, so you have only to wait here.
Jami has to go see Julia.
I don't think I ought to do that.
Do you think that you can do that by yourself?
I don't think that Tommy is listening to me.
Jacob knew that what he did was wrong.
There's always a catch.
I want to know if you have a driver's license.
They should know it.
When does Jack want to do this?
You've got to be ready for anything.
May I come tomorrow, too?
Did Tommy say he didn't have to do that?
We all couldn't believe it.
Slow down.
I'd really love a cold glass of milk.
Why don't you just call for help?
Jack climbed down the fire escape.
I went to the beach last weekend with George.
I wasn't paying attention in class today.
Show it to mom!
I thought she was pretty.
I spent the best times of my life at my grandfather's house.
You have no idea how hard I've had to work to do this.
His name has slipped my mind.
Do you agree to our proposal?
What's going on with you? You haven't been talking to me for a while now.
"Whose car is that over there?" "It's Jami's."
I don't consider myself an idiot.
You seem really nice.
Adam will probably tell Mary what he needs to do.
The idiots are always yelling at each other for stupid reasons.
Oliver likes listening to classical music.
I wonder whether William and Alice are really tired.
William's parents never told him about the facts of life.
Jacob has been helping us all day.
Fulfill your duty.
Who's behind you?
Would you like for me to help you?
I didn't do that just for fun.
There are many modern buildings around here.
Adam said he wouldn't mind doing that for Olivia.
It's called the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
We really want to win.
I'm surrounded by enemies.
We can watch on the screen you see in front of you.
It tastes like chicken.
Do you know why William is doing that?
George can do it better than I can.
Eva reads to improve her mind.
All the humans were replaced by robots.
Would you like me to thread the needle for you?
Right now, it is a half past ten.
I didn't meet anyone.
How much time will she spend at Pierre's?
We could have waited, but we decided to leave without Jacob.
Muhammad can learn anything.
It's very slow.
I'll contact you later.
This message turned out to be a little hard for me to write.
This car is always breaking down lately.
His delay of coming here on time is due to a traffic accident.
Oscar is studying at his desk.
I didn't get paid much do that.
I left my card at home.
I don't like having to admit I can't read.
Could you sign here, please?
Why did you do that to Adam?
The first stage of the operation has been accomplished.
This will only take a moment.
Sometimes it seems that no matter what you do, you can't make a difference.
Adam said that he's already talked to Valentina about that.
Don't tell me you've never been to Boston.
I don't have any idea where Oliver is.
If Oscar really liked me, he would've called me last night.
I am not all too certain of my position.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Jack and Valentina kissed each other more than once.
It didn't seem necessary.
Everybody knew William didn't want to do that.
Alex said he didn't care whether we stayed or not.
Jami asked Eva out to dinner, but she said no.
You should buy one for Jami, too.
Jack is a self-educated man.
Monica said she's determined to do that.
He knocked on the door, then came in.
You should have waited until we got here before you started eating.
We can't afford another failure.
Tommy started to yell at Catherine.
He put on his rubber gloves.
That's actually what happened.
The details really don't matter.
You must drink when you're thirsty.
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.
We have no idea about his whereabouts.
Please make sure the drinking water is pure.
Did you enjoy yourself last evening?
I won't eat breakfast tomorrow.
Muhammad didn't tell me about it.
You aren't tall enough, are you?
She stood close to her husband.
Jacob told me that he was going to Boston next week.
James said that he thought that he could do that today.
Oscar will have to help me.
Perhaps Adam is waiting for a reply.
I hope James doesn't win.
Julia gave me her phone number.
Could you come over to my place tomorrow?
I took him at his word.
I'm well aware of the problems we face.
Don't you think we should let Julia do whatever she wants?
Oscar was feeling pretty tired.
Immediate measures are needed.
Do you ever teach?
I speak Spanish a little bit.
Can I talk to you over here for a second?
He often comes late.
They received a positive response.
Nothing bad ever happens.
Yes? What were you looking for?
Nobody pays attention to William.
I missed one.
The teacher went back to his desk.
May I ask her a few questions?
Do I need to set the table?
Nobody had ever heard of it.
Tell Harry I'll sign the contract.
I like your dog.
Do you want any help, Charlie?
Give me two hours.
James and Catherine wished they hadn't asked John to quit doing that.
I'll tell my mom!
When you see Harry, please give this to him.
Alex has told me he has to go to Australia next week.
Harry and Monica are interested in animals.
How stupid do you have to be to send naked pictures of yourself to anybody?
Get out of my head! Get out!
This is my very last chance to see Joe.
I'll do my best to be there by 2:30.
I didn't know someone still lived in that house.
We'll all be there.
Monica told me she wasn't upset.
Nobody can help her.
I am not used to drinking coffee without sugar.
Jack may have taken my umbrella by mistake.
What do I care what they think?
There was no emergency.
Tommy told me he hoped Anna would be able to do that.
They said that they were sick.
They were very proud of themselves.
I went to the beach yesterday.
May I do that when I'm in Boston?
Tommy wrapped the present he was going to give to Carmen.
Mary is beautiful and intelligent.
You shouldn't have kissed Jack yesterday.
I'm pretty sure Jami will do that.
Jacob managed to sell his car for a lot of money.
Tell me about him. What does he look like?
I know Muhammad knows Margaret can't do that.
Our future is at stake.
He listened carefully so that he might not miss a single word.
George felt he had to do something.
You have no idea why Oscar wanted you to stop doing that.
Tommy is hard to reach, isn't he?
Did Charlie and Catherine say why they were leaving?
I saw James holding your hand.
Muhammad never wins.
What do you think about this outfit?
We don't get along.
Emma admitted she was wrong.
Harry isn't sure what else he should do.
I believe that you will love it!
It made no difference.
William hardly ever keeps his word.
Emma said she did that in 2013.
That could take a while.
Bill is as tall as Jack.
Well, what shall we do for fun today...
Joe and Julia are going to be just fine.
I'm going to figure this out.
Jack and Alice say they don't have time to do that now.
Oliver sold used cars for a while.
I'm very surprised that Jack couldn't do that.
Don't break her heart.
He did everything he could for his child.
Just make this stop.
I'm never going to give up trying.
You need to keep trying until you get it right.
We're going to have to deal with it tomorrow.
He sent me a comic book from Germany.
That wasn't what I expected to happen.
How did Alice get James to help her with her homework?
We always love best the people who need us.
Emma isn't sure what else she can do.
She'll be gone abroad in another six months.
Oscar could no longer contain his anger.
Jack told me that he thought that it would rain all day.
You can borrow a copy from any public library.
I didn't want Oliver to buy me an expensive engagement ring.
Please explain what's happening here.
William said he didn't want a party on his birthday.
He kindly answered the question.
He can't manage on his own.
I've played tennis for years and years.
I can't come to work tomorrow.
Save me a piece of pie.
Winter is here, and the weather's getting cold.
Margaret looks like she's relieved.
Don't you remember her?
Even if you're right, what's the difference?
Harry and Laur looked like they were satisfied.
He asked me to do it.
He is not sitting on a bench.
He looked like he was curious.
I'll ask Carmen why she agreed to do that.
Help me take this apart.
I didn't want to be late for my first class.
I grew desperate.
She isn't what she seems.
I still have time to do that before 2:30.
We need a bottle of juice.
No one else came to the meeting.
Why are you all here?
You're powerful.
I'm not allowed to do that.
Food is cheap in Germany.
Oscar is still working at the same company.
He still hasn't paid his rent.
I wanted to tell George that I couldn't do that.
I don't want any more complaining.
That's too expensive for me to buy.
Nobody's seen Alex and Alice in a month.
So far I haven't had to do that.
James is still trying to figure out what caused the accident.
Tommy doesn't want to go away.
There are about 1000 students at our high school.
I can hardly remember Alex.
You seem to be lost.
The excited woman tried to explain the accident all in one breath.
Mother told me to behave myself.
James and Catherine can move it by themselves.
He knows how to paint houses.
I knew that Charlie was a lot younger than Susie.
Thursday night is free beer night.
I'm used to thinking on my feet.
Jacob was introduced to Anna by John.
He convinced me that his brother was innocent.
Jacob should've been able to do that without Catherine's help.
William thinks he'll probably never fall in love.
Adam didn't have everything he wanted.
Jacob and Olivia won't change their minds.
We need to find a solution soon.
Would you like a cup of milk?
Once he got a taste, you couldn't keep him away from it.
What does Oliver expect?
We know it's important to you.
I didn't have enough money to buy that.
The sun is about 1,000,000 times as large as the earth.
How can you feel sorry for someone like that?
I don't think we want to risk that happening.
Adam has to worry about himself.
Margaret told Jacob that she wanted his help.
Oscar asked Monica to ask John about that.
I thought Tommy and Emma were going to be shot.
I've been making decisions all day.
Alex and I are married.
Joe wanted to hear every detail.
Today is October 20th.
Do you know what Jack did yesterday?
Don't let anything slow you down.
Don't let her escape!
Let Jacob and Valentina buy whatever they want.
I know Oliver doesn't know why Olivia did that by herself.
Where can I wash my hands before I eat?
I myself didn't have to go and meet him there.
I want to hear from her.
I couldn't have planned this.
I often make use of the library to study.
This room is awfully cold.
Oliver says he's not planning on doing that.
I advise you not to keep company with Jacob.
Tommy came away impressed.
I knew that Joe didn't how long it was going to take to do that.
I thought would make it easier.
They can't do it by themselves.
The lesson being over, children ran out into the hall.
Do you want to know who did this?
His wife gave birth to twins.
Have you ever been abroad?
I have to leave early in the morning.
I got it for free.
As far as I know, he is innocent.
The French president is to visit Japan next month.
He has lung cancer.
I should've visited Boston, but I didn't.
Today's play really moved me.
Hand it to him.
Charlie said he thought he might not need to do that by himself.
She told me she was really hungry.
I saw him coming upstairs.
George said he couldn't help us today.
You know about that, don't you?
William paid for Julia's French lessons.
I'm no longer working for them.
Alex looked like he was occupied.
Thank you for helping me keep out of trouble.
I'm just saying you shouldn't trust Harry.
Can you come to my country?
Time flew.
If anyone calls for me, tell them I'm not here.
Many people believe that our country's politicians are corrupt.
I was an honest man until 1985.
I'm never happier than when I'm by myself.
Adam sat down next to the fire.
I've seen the way you look at Jacob.
You can also go up with the elevator.
I don't know what's in there.
I can't just leave him there.
This is only for your personal use.
Can't you come to Australia with William?
He couldn't stop laughing.
Alex can't help move the piano because he has a bad back.
You're so stuck up.
My mother and I were in the garden all afternoon.
I don't think we're alone.
This book isn't very good.
Oscar's death was an accident.
Harry told Laur to turn the radio off.
Do you think that people are mean to you?
Joe wondered what Alice was planning to do.
I want to deal with this letter before I do anything else.
Have you checked this with her?
I can't talk to you here. It's too dangerous.
Did you forget to buy eggs?
Did you explain the situation to Oliver?
I know that Jacob hasn't been doing that.
Do you desire to surprise your loved one tonight?
This is the wrong way!
Did you realize that you haven't eaten anything since this morning?
They can't hurt you now.
Harry was falling-down drunk.
Who invented glasses?
I don't like to laugh.
Tommy made a fool of himself.
We have experienced many changes over the last decade.
I've lost track of them.
Her father is Japanese.
I'm ordering a steak. I suggest you do the same.
Don't you know that he passed away two years ago?
We bought a pound of tea.
How did you like the party?
We have the necessary equipment.
I'll just go check.
It isn't any different from what I expected.
When does the last train leave?
Tommy has to be the last one to do that.
F*uk you
Maybe it was stupid of me to think that Jack would really help us.
Everyone should know this.
They attempted to escape.
Where can we have lunch?
We're not going to talk to Harry.
Muhammad didn't hurt anyone, did he?
What do you want such an old car for?
I don't think that we should do that the way Muhammad told us to.
Will you ever make money doing that?
It's not my choice.
Oliver is almost as tall as I am.
Doesn't that mean anything?
We're on the wrong track.
Mom put me to work against my will.
I should have at least offered to pay.
George failed in business.
I don't want to do that the way Oscar suggested.
I thought that you said that it was getting fixed.
I'm not being naive.
I wasn't able to pass the test.
You and Adam will have a lot to talk about.
Don't rely on his help.
Muhammad opened the door quietly, so he wouldn't wake Monica up.
They felt he had no chance to win the election.
Do you know a good film?
We've been invited to a costume party.
I thought that Tommy had gotten out of the hospital.
Compared to basketball, baseball might be considered a little slow and boring.
I want my freedom.
I think Alex and Mary are finished doing that.
George said he's always lived on Park Street.
That calls for a drink.
Harry hadn't expected that.
Joe could have been quicker at doing that than Laur if he'd tried harder.
Charlie was at Lucy's house.
I'm in complete agreement with everything he said.
I like swimming in the sea.
Oliver and Catherine live with their parents in a small house.
Are you wearing new shoes?
I used to be the same age as you.
Children always want to become adults.
Jack talked about growing up in Boston.
Would you be quiet, please?
They are now sitting in conference on that question.
In England, in the summer, the sun rises at about 4 a.m.
Charlie is the only one likely to be able to convince Julia to do that.
Adam said that you were happy here.
I don't need your money.
Let's begin.
Haven't you got nothing better to do?
James said that he thought that you could do that.
She thinks that she's always right.
I do believe in miracles.
It has affected us.
Do you know which book sells well now?
You have lots of friends.
I know what your problem is.
"Harry made me an offer of marriage." "At long last!"
I knew Oliver was a truck driver.
I have confidence in you.
Did you grade the tests?
Joe didn't take his hat off.
I couldn't call you. The telephone was out of order.
Carmen stopped to catch her breath.
They just wanted to be left alone.
My friend wrote me a letter in which he asks if I am well.
Two men were on watch round the body.
Jacob should've trusted his instinct.
No sooner had Olivia broken up with Charlie than John asked her out.
Oscar thinks that we won't be able to win.
Oscar is just trying to protect Laur.
The person that told me the mall closes at 9:00 p.m. was wrong.
George said I shouldn't tell Alice to do that.
I am in Russia.
I want you to go to church.
Jacob doesn't want the same things Monica wants.
Don't you ever say anything?
Nothing gets past you.
What makes you think I wasn't trying?
Tommy said that tomorrow is Monday.
Dan rented that car from London.
James thinks that he'll die soon.
I'm not sure where to put this.
It's safer to stay here.
He fell a victim to his own ambition.
I'm usually the one who takes out the garbage.
He was too sleepy to read the evening newspaper.
That's so lame.
Jacob doesn't understand why we're doing this.
I doubt if Tommy will be interested in doing that.
Hand me that phone.
Is anybody on the line?
How do you go there? By car?
Jacob didn't seem surprised that Julia didn't know what to do.
Laur admitted she did what she promised not to do.
The sky is clear and the sun is bright.
Joe and Anna were childhood friends, right?
Were Alex and Carmen caught?
Walking along the street, I found a wallet.
What do you mean by 'White Anglo-Saxon'? Have there ever been any black, yellow or red Anglo-Saxons?
Divide the cake among the three of you.
He loves to gossip.
I'm sure it's a good one.
She said she had no regrets.
That woman knows who I am and loves me anyway.
I'm short of cash at the moment.
Are you sure that you can do that?
Would you like me to ask Jami to buy that for you?
Doing this is a lot of fun.
Carmen broke her own record.
Will James be allowed to go camping with the other children?
Let me pay my share of the expenses.
Adam said that Laur was planning on going by herself.
Is that Adam's daughter?
Many soldiers were killed in World War II.
May I have this dance?
I've made a complaint.
The actor is nowhere near as popular as he used to be.
It won't be any fun unless William and Margaret do that with us.
It's obvious what he's trying to do.
I understand you're going to Australia next week.
I come back home at 6:30.
I'm going to give everything back soon.
We were glad when we saw a light in the distance.
I will hit Laur.
I don't work for her anymore.
He told me he was done.
If it happens to rain, the garden party won't be held.
I wonder whether or not Muhammad is afraid.
Who has eaten all the cookies?
She said she wasn't cold.
I think Adam is going to call you.
These are really just excuses.
They don't want her there.
I'm sorry I'm late. It won't happen again.
Muhammad and I should've gone there ourselves.
It took me an hour to learn the poem by heart.
Alex is an education major.
I enjoy eating hot soup.
You can sleep here if you want.
Adam is going to school in Boston.
I don't even have a pair of shoes.
I'd like to continue working here.
French is very difficult to learn.
I am pressed for time.
I don't want to go to the circus with James.
I was surprised that Jack had to do that.
Joe has psychological problems.
Our friends took a walk in the park.
I'd like a book.
We already have three events booked for next week.
I never thought that about you.
We need to hire someone to take care of this problem.
Charlie has been living in Boston for almost ten years.
I knew it could happen.
George did it on his own.
Jacob has a knife in his right hand.
Joe suddenly got happy when Catherine walked into the room.
I assume I was invited.
Gambling brought about his ruin.
Getting George to show up on time won't be easy.
Can we stay in Australia for a few weeks?
Do you know my son?
Oliver said Julia knew John might be required to do that in the near future.
I'm at the prison.
How do they decide how many hours you work per week?
It was more difficult to do that than George said it would be.
Susie came here on her own.
Let the party begin.
Oscar was really good at that.
They told me they want to die.
I want to buy a new bicycle.
What language do you use at work?
Jami's car is parked in front of my car.
They sat down by the fire.
Give him a break!
Charlie forgot to buy what Susie asked him to buy.
One should not say bad words.
I need your help to get out of here.
I see you got yourself a new bicycle.
James put the gun to his own head and pulled the trigger.
James has nowhere left to go.
Emma is going to have to do it all by herself.
I almost never sleep past 6:30 in the morning.
I don't think that we should do that again.
That guy over there looks like Oscar.
I don't think that Jami and Carmen were hungry.
I must get off at the next station.
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.
Anna said she knew Muhammad wouldn't win.
Maybe Alex will just leave us alone.
Let me see if Jacob is ready.
Without water, we can not survive.
I want to be a physician in the future.
I'd like to improve my English skills.
Alex is old enough to be your grandfather.
He was the only one not invited to the party.
Do you think George and Olivia are finished doing that?
He didn't like his mother.
That's your problem, not mine.
My office is on the fifth floor.
Charlie jumped into the pool from the roof.
Catherine looks like she's having a bad day.
They left their tickets at home.
Can you call a taxi for me?
This is my dream job.
He called her mobile.
A man without his language has lost his land.
She provided me with some food.
I was on my way over to Jami's right now.
You're a tool.
I don't think that you two should get married.
It's important we find him.
They walked slowly towards her.
By the way, do you think there's anything after death?
The secret was out.
He came down the hill on his bicycle.
Harry said that I didn't look like my brother.
May I introduce you to my wife?
Alice would tell us the truth, wouldn't she?
Who's that gentleman?
Jack has a doctor's appointment this afternoon.
I have a few friends to talk for a long time on the phone with.
Tell Harry when he should do that.
Oscar wanted Anna to learn French.
This is the first time I've driven a car.
Next year we have to clean the whole beach.
James will probably be the first one to be fired.
I knew that Jack wouldn't want me to do that.
Would you please answer the phone?
I'll give you to the count of three.
Weren't Jack and Catherine in Boston last week?
I will focus on the explanation of the festival.
Charlie knows that I'm here.
They are as strong as us.
They live near the beach.
James wasn't told anything.
They're locked in.
Has he come?
You have your work cut out for you.
I doubt James has the courage to do that.
Doing your best is better than doing nothing at all.
Jami and Valentina want to see us.
I felt a sharp pain in my stomach.
They say they'll never do that again.
I don't have to do anything right now.
I help her.
I considered not going.
We're concerned about your health.
What difference does it make if people do that?
James said he figured that he could win.
I think Muhammad is incredible.
They said that they didn't know what to do.
Did Muhammad forget to pay?
Our restaurant doesn't get many customers on Monday.
Are those yours?
He's an artist.
Didn't Charlie agree to do that?
Emma took something from her pocket and gave it to Alex.
There is almost no water in this bottle.
Alex is through here.
Please take a look at this.
George tried to show Eva how to do it.
Alice is very absent-minded, isn't she?
It was marvelous.
What chocolate do you like to eat?
I did what I was supposed to do.
Some parts of this city are very ugly.
I'm not holding you back.
They believed he was honest.
Laur offered me a beer, but I told her I didn't want one.
Joe was finally captured.
I thought that you said that you enjoyed golf.
I wonder whether or not Jami has already told Monica not to do that.
I am tied to my desk and chair.
Listen to the teachers.
I can speak Chinese.
Please get in touch with me when you come to Tokyo.
We think of William as an honest man.
We'll be back by 2:30.
I knew Jack would be the winner.
The next time that I see Harry, I'm going to tell him that.
Alex helped me do that.
Jack asked me to give this to you.
I sweep the floor.
I would like to do more.
James and Margaret only did what they had to do.
Alex said that he thinks you're stupid.
Oliver agreed to let Mary teach French.
They found their new jobs interesting.
I've seen what happens when you don't follow the rules.
Did you really not know that Adam wouldn't want to do that?
Are you actually serious?
Alex said he wished that he hadn't let Emma kiss him.
I don't think Jami knows if Julia is sleepy or not.
Julia could do that in her sleep.
She takes good care of herself.
No one knows exactly where George is going to go.
Catherine said she wanted to help us do that.
Washington was the most famous man in America.
It won't be hard for us to do this.
I was very ashamed of what I had done.
I told everyone to be careful.
We can pitch our tent anywhere we want.
William decided that it would be fun to go camping with John and Lucy.
Please let me see your passport and boarding pass.
I don't know whether you like her or not.
So are you married to Sarah?
I can go wherever you like.
Do you really think Jack will let you do that?
From that day on, he'll never say hello to me again.
George and Julia are thin, aren't they?
William is more wise than clever.
I would've told you how to do it right.
That's a fine way to treat a friend.
You look like my sister.
You wouldn't survive.
I don't play guitar anymore.
He looks like he's ready.
Joe isn't likely to be up.
Who made that decision?
Charlie said he would have done that if he'd known Eva wanted him to.
You can't leave him behind.
Oscar and Mary pretended they didn't understand what John wanted them to do.
Unlike him, his son is tall.
Charlie and I both do that.
Muhammad always says everything is my fault.
William should just let Alice do that.
We may never win another game.
Don't look for us.
I'll drive you to the airport.
It took Oscar several hours to finish his homework.
I haven't seen him here before.
I thought George had a place to live.
Oliver is already drunk, isn't he?
Tommy thought that Eva was going to win.
I knew that James would like it if we did that.
I was called in for jury this morning, and I actually have to serve on a case.
Joe is the one who wanted to do that.
I wonder where to hang this picture that James gave me.
That's her home.
George will be in Australia next year.
Adam loves fly-fishing.
Do you really think Harry likes Carmen?
Jacob won't allow anybody to do that.
Charlie is a former student of mine.
He went to New York by airplane.
Muhammad was contacted by Monica.
Mary finally realized that Harry was never going to propose to her.
Oscar made Anna wait a long time.
I meet her once a week.
I'm sure of this.
I hope James remembers this.
I'll call you soon.
William can't stay here by himself.
"How do you have your coffee?" "White with two, thanks."
Mary may have gone fishing by herself.
I put boots on.
Dan decided to leave town.
We aren't willing to do that.
I caught him cheating in the examination.
I didn't know Jacob had asked Emma to help him.
What was he doing in your room?
Where there's harmony, there's order.
Alice wants me to lie for her.
I expect that Harry will eat before he comes.
We'll take care of ourselves.
George said that he thought that Carmen wasn't ready to do that.
Speed kills.
Where's my tea?
Yes, I have seen one many times.
He should've stayed where he was.
Oscar is a member of this club.
The cowboy counted all the cattle.
Adam didn't tell me why he was so angry.
Jami said that Carmen thought John might want to do that early tomorrow morning.
We're going out for a walk after lunch.
I have another option.
Oscar told me Lucy wasn't scared.
He doesn't speak English, and even less French.
Do you have any books written in French?
Jami called me at home.
James wants to do that today.
He wasn't as handsome as she told me.
I think they will drink elsewhere.
You're a fraud.
I know Charlie doesn't know why you need to do that by yourselves.
The boat goes down the river.
Has Oliver admitted defeat?
I think we should let Adam go to Boston by himself.
I didn't think that Jacob would swim by himself.
It was magic.
Jack said he'd lend me some money.
I wonder who he really is.
I didn't know that Joe was going to kiss me.
Tommy sent Lucy his picture.
They continued fighting.
Excuse me, could you pass me the sugar?
It was the best tea Adam had ever drunk.
He didn't deserve to lose his job.
I see a queen.
This drawing is less than great. He needs to do something with the line here at the back of the leg.
I hate violence.
I'm new around here.
Please tell Catherine not to do that by herself.
I thought you said Jack needed more time.
What do you associate with summer?
We can't help Alex.
He denied he said that.
But we've seen it before.
Your hair will grow back.
Was Charlie able to do that well?
I thought Jack and Olivia were in Australia.
I hope we'll see each other again soon.
"Will you help me, George?" "No, not again. Ask someone else!"
The police recovered the stolen jewels.
Oscar told Margaret he was planning to stay in Boston until October.
He has as many books as his father does.
Tommy told Margaret that she had to do that.
Can Adam actually speak French?
Try to stay a bit more alert to what goes on around you.
Adam walked out of the movie because he was too scared.
Why don't you start by telling us what you saw?
The old man sat on the bench with his eyes closed.
The world changes faster and faster.
Oscar can swim about as well as Mary.
My pencil fell from the edge of my table.
We went over all the details.
James said that he thought the economy was likely to get better.
What did the businessman say when he invented the zip-fastener?
I'm afraid that Alex might do that.
William opened the door slightly.
She did the very best she could.
Adam is going to take a walk in the park this afternoon.
I thought you needed money.
I plan to go home by myself.
It is better for the health to live in the country than in the city.
Try the cake.
I guess Anna changed her mind.
He threw the book in the fire.
We need to be very careful not to let anybody hear what we're saying.
You should ask Oscar directly.
I met her in London for the first time.
He did not like my book.
While they don't agree, they continue to be friends.
I'll do the same thing you do.
Nobody seems to have the guts to do that anymore.
William knew Mary didn't have to do that.
I wish I had more money.
Were you to know the fact you would be surprised.
I won't make the same mistake twice.
Muhammad went through the file.
All women are beautiful.
Oliver was extremely protective.
She told herself that she should go.
May God help you, as you have put yourself beyond the mercy of men.
Watch out! A car is coming!
Who did you buy this for?
She said she's frustrated.
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
They have many different dishes to try.
I know you need it.
Is this how you handle all of your problems?
What happened between the two of you?
I share an apartment with her.
Mary says she intended to do that.
It seems like she will win a prize.
Olivia is likely going to spend the rest of her life in jail.
I didn't stay with William in Australia.
I need to know more about her.
I don't think Jami has time to talk to you.
The picture reminds me of my school days.
That's funny stuff.
What do you suggest?
That's a lot of help.
I have weak sight.
I don't think that you'd like that.
I thought that you didn't like Adam.
That would be a highly dangerous option for both sides.
I'll buy Oscar a beer.
This is quite possibly the greatest album ever!
Eva said that she had to leave early.
You'll have to come back in a while: the man dealing with that business has just gone out.
You're the only one who doesn't know how to do this, aren't you?
No one in their right mind would walk in those woods at night.
Maybe Tommy and I aren't supposed to do this.
Oliver brought Valentina to the hospital.
How much would you like?
I'm not sure which way I should turn.
I'm badly in need of your help.
Try to have a positive attitude about everything.
I thought that my parents would be proud of me.
Harry was the one who cooked dinner.
Valentina didn't tell anyone why she had gone to Boston.
I don't know about you, but I'm starving.
I wish you had called ahead.
Charlie didn't go to the hospital.
You have three choices.
They needed her.
What could they possibly want from us?
I hear that both Muhammad and Anna are planning to retire in October.
That man asked me who I was, but I didn't think it was necessary to answer that question.
It isn't as simple as you think to do that.
I don't like to do the same kinds of things that William likes to do.
I'm afraid Charlie's not going to recover.
I can't tell you.
Joe wanted me to speak French.
He took care of his sick mother.
Catherine told me she was planning to go to college in Boston.
I heard my name called in the dark.
There is a large house on the hill.
I knew Jacob was here somewhere.
I wonder if Jack really did what he was supposed to do.
Muhammad and Alice said they haven't decided what they'll do.
Does Muhammad know why you left early?
I shouldn't have left early.
I'm going to Australia soon.
I suspect Charlie will do whatever you ask him to do.
We're in favor of your plan.
He doesn't want to work in a factory.
She has said she needs to do that.
I'll be back around 2:30.
William did it on Monday.
Catherine put her pencil down.
Alex signed his name with the new pen that he got from Mary.
You're a right little rascal!
Let me carry that for you.
Would you mind if I look around?
I can't remember what I'm supposed to do.
Harry is watching, isn't he?
It was insane!
I don't understand you either.
Julia said she thought she might be the only one who wanted to do that.
Why don't you ask Jacob to go with you?
George told his children an amusing story.
She loves her and me.
She is very intelligent and passionate.
She had some trouble with him before.
I know you came to Australia in October.
Will you join me?
I suspect Adam probably won't want to do that.
I don't think James helped Olivia.
I find that suspicious.
I don't like it when Harry leaves his dirty clothes on the floor.
I couldn't turn down the job.
What color is your dress?
I guess I'll see you later.
My name is Jim.
Laurie's still at school.
Tommy was paying really close attention.
He's in his office at his desk.
Jami and Susie say they regret having been rude to you.
Oscar told Julia that he was going to go to Australia.
Charlie showed up at the party dressed as a pirate.
Look at the stars.
Harry gave me Mary's phone number.
Today I get off work at 2:30.
I don't have as much money as he does.
For the record, Jack didn't have anything to do with this.
Didn't I tell you Alex would blow it?
Mrs. Wood was a very good cook.
There's no way I can catch Alex.
I hope no one sees you like this.
I don't care how much money you make.
She said that it might be true.
I don't think that William enjoyed the concert.
I didn't know the gun was loaded.
I wish I'd gone to Australia with Adam.
Alex said that he and his friends were planning to go camping next weekend.
Muhammad seems nice enough.
Every person is a moon, and has a dark side that they never show.
I'm glad you were here.
Oliver probably doesn't know where Susie plans to spend her summer vacation.
I thought you guys had a big party tonight.
He wished he hadn't won.
That would be possible.
I'll do it for a cake.
I'm disappointed Harry isn't here.
That was why I was late.
George was just happy to have someone to talk to.
I worked for her.
I thought Alex found them.
How did you know I used to live in Boston?
Alex stopped the car and got out.
We are worried about you.
I wonder if keeping your head down and living safely is a survival instinct.
I'm having an awesome time.
Her boyfriend was really angry at her.
I'm afraid my opinion on the matter is different.
I know that name.
We can't let Joe win.
What is the difference between this and that?
I can play the guitar. Jack can, too.
Oscar usually eats lunch at twelve o'clock.
Jack can't have done that.
I had met him once before.
I hope you are more successful next time.
I don't own a black suit.
Tears filled Monica's eyes.
I really like them a lot.
I'm the only person who can probably help Harry do that.
She washed herself.
I want to have a proper house and garden.
I cared about her.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
We need points.
There are limits, you see, to our friend's intelligence.
We should've warned Charlie of the danger.
Jami didn't mention his reason for being late.
I want to learn Irish.
I won't have time to do today.
Olivia said she's been to Boston.
Let me take a picture of you.
Charlie and Valentina say they don't think John really did that.
My father went nuts when he saw me hanging out with her.
You have quite a temper.
Jacob didn't plan to go to Boston.
I feel we're speaking a different language.
That's not happening till October 20th.
I can't speak French. I can't speak English either.
He was smiling as if nothing had happened to him.
I need a day off.
What does that mean, anyway?
I thought that Jacob could handle the job if I gave him a chance.
Neither of them was comfortable talking about the relationship.
I know my day will come.
I know Alex hasn't gotten around to doing that yet.
I hope you're lucky.
She ended off her speech with some jokes.
I wish I had been kind to her then.
He hates secrets.
Jami didn't use to like red wine, but now he drinks it almost every day.
What's not fair?
Do Jack and Julia wear wedding rings?
Oliver plans on leaving Boston next year.
Your guests are waiting.
I was just trying to cheer you up.
Why can't you watch where you're going?
Harry didn't want anyone to see him.
There's the bell.
Jack is looking very pleased with himself.
You knew Oliver, didn't you?
Laur thought that she would be late.
Adam said that he didn't know that Olivia couldn't swim very well.
The bank is three blocks away.
If there's time this week, shall we try once?
I know that you don't often do that in the morning.
Is there something special about the way Jami and Monica do that?
He ate Mr Wood's good country food, and drank a lot of milk.
James is helping me right now.
I slept at ten o'clock in the evening.
That's not altogether bad.
What's the secret?
I'd like to see that contract.
I brought you some candy.
I missed a lot of shots.
Harry asked me if I'd mind doing that for him.
Dancing isn't a crime.
I wasn't here yesterday.
Jami has already delivered the package to Carmen's house.
Whose coat is that?
Jack said that Valentina wasn't going to Australia.
Maybe your dreams will be realized today!
I'm the only one who survived.
Oscar and Mary won't visit Australia.
Turn at that corner there.
I run a tight ship.
Did Charlie tell you about his past?
I'm not an expert either.
I thought I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
The kitchen sink was full of dirty dishes.
Joe said that he was going to do that the day before yesterday, but he didn't have time.
Oscar remained in Australia until 2013.
Oscar thinks that anything's possible.
I thought Jack had seen me.
It could have been you.
James thought Julia knew who his father was.
Who told you to do that?
Joe plays the guitar almost as well as Lucy does.
I'd never go back to eating meat.
We need to protect Oliver.
I think that it's absolutely essential.
Few people know anything about the plan.
Harry and his wife both enjoy playing chess.
He gets a haircut once a month.
Muhammad gave Catherine a passionate kiss.
Please help yourself to some more cake.
Please give me a chance to explain.
Instead of going back to the party, why don't we go to my place?
Harry is going to be arrested if he does that again.
It'll probably be tough for Harry to do that.
What you said is true.
Please come to talk to me.
They say they've never cried.
We should've stayed home with Tommy.
You're a mean person.
If you don't think the party is going to be any fun, why are you planning to go to it?
What's in Boston?
William and I are always busy.
Jami and Anna let me know that they planned on doing that.
That's a really shallow thing to say.
He still lives with his parents.
Who's your favorite super hero?
If he hadn't wasted time, he'd be finished by now.
How bad will it get?
I don't like suck-ups.
James said he doesn't care at all.
Carmen sat down next to someone she didn't know.
Jack needs to talk to Catherine.
They tell me you're OK.
Harry was put in jail.
This substance is in solid state.
William decided to give online dating a try and it changed his life!
Let me have a word with Muhammad.
You can't let George get away with that.
It came to nothing.
She is now better off than when she was young.
Jacob got Carmen to scratch the part of his back he couldn't reach.
I'll show that to them.
Something must be done immediately to deal with this problem.
None of us plan on staying here much longer.
He took me by the collar.
Jami is leaving tomorrow, isn't he?
I am on good terms with my brother.
Can you describe the object?
I know that I can't change Tommy's mind.
Too much exercise does more harm than good.
It's absolutely impossible for me to go on like this.
Even if I grant that what you say is true, it is no excuse.
I told William about the party.
I thought that Muhammad might know Monica.
These are the facts. Think hard about them!
Does Oscar drink wine?
I want to speak with them.
Joe gave the sheet of paper to Susie.
State your full name for the record.
Jami doesn't know how to drive.
Are you washing the car?
She got the children ready for a walk.
Have you ever breast-fed a baby?
Dan began to search the house.
I learned how to do that last summer.
Wake up at seven, please.
Oscar is shopping at the mall.
You should have gone to James's concert.
Jami doesn't do that the way he used to.
Let go of them.
It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I'm going to go change my clothes.
Everyone thought Harry was from Australia.
I didn't think Jack would lie to you.
Give me back my hat.
Alex hates your guts.
The baseball match will come off next week.
I don't know whether you are telling the truth or not.
Let's not do that here.
Harry announced he was planning to do that.
George and Carmen say they don't think they could do that without our help.
I saw her play the piano.
I went to see the ballet.
James wanted to know who was going to help Anna.
Oscar and Margaret say that they're good at French.
Let's talk about safety.
Adam said he still feels pain in his legs.
We have to stay here whether we want to or not.
How long does it take to get from Boston to Chicago by car?
I suggest we wait for one more hour.
I think I know what to do.
The girl was badly injured in the traffic accident.
We'll be leaving in a few minutes.
You can't fill your stomach with the food left on your beard.
I said I'll do that for you.
I live in the Boston area.
Why did George stop?
I don't think that's anybody I know.
Her hands are never still.
Seen from a distance, he looks much younger than he really is.
Jack began coughing.
You are so beautiful, you do not need to use makeup.
Who did George and Alice plan to give that to?
They named the child after the grandfather.
We must go to school.
I hardly ever talk to anyone at work.
Don't you think you'll move back to Boston, eventually?
Muhammad took an apple from the fruit bowl.
I didn't do that quickly enough.
I told George I was going to handle it.
I know Muhammad didn't know that I could do that.
When were you in London?
He was fired from his job.
I'd do it myself, but I'm a little busy right now.
Charlie isn't going to be very happy about that.
Put a pan of water on the stove.
Do you think that aliens exist?
They didn't ask that.
Muhammad and Carmen said that they were lonely.
I don't use paper towels.
Can we have a word outside?
I don't think you can gain his ear.
I can't stand people like you.
We had a chance.
I can't go until he comes.
Oliver isn't the only one I know in Boston.
I would have never done that.
There are a few hotels on Park Street.
I don't think that Jacob knows what he's talking about.
Alex has found an easy way to make money.
I told Jacob I wasn't interested in discussing my problems with him.
Have you ever jumped from a bridge into the sea?
I'm in a hurry for school and I can't talk with anybody right now.
They said they never felt tired.
Greece has many islands.
I didn't believe that either.
It's important that James hears this.
What would Jami and Catherine do?
We're all dying.
Oliver stood up and looked about.
He lost his hearing.
He threw himself into reading.
I think there's a good chance that that'll happen.
William says he hopes that Mary does that.
Valentina knew that she wasn't likely to be arrested.
I thought Adam would make breakfast.
Harry hasn't told us what he needs to do yet.
I don't think that we have to do this now.
You make me laugh a lot.
When it comes to physics, no one comes close to him.
Jacob has been treating you fairly, hasn't he?
But the answers were all wrong.
Alex said he didn't think that he had to do that today.
They worked until they dropped.
I doubt very seriously that Charlie will be fair.
I'm sorry. I got the wrong number.
Turn off the television. I can't concentrate.
Everyone but Julia has already gone home.
I don't want to play this game.
I will stop him from going.
I was able to finish the work earlier than I had expected.
I know James isn't a violin teacher. He can't even play the violin.
Why I didn't think of that?
Jami can't find his watch.
Jacob said that he thought Lucy didn't like John very much.
I don't want to talk to him.
Tommy and Olivia said they've been to Boston.
I figured Jacob would panic.
Jacob has to study hard and catch up with the other students in his class.
Tommy didn't say where Carmen was.
Mary can still take care of herself.
Let us handle this.
Muhammad has already been told that he doesn't need to do that.
Are these dogs yours?
George was very sure Lucy could do that.
This is why I was afraid to tell you.
Why did George think it was a good idea to do that?
You won't need those.
We've got to get Charlie to bed.
I don't think Muhammad is weak.
I'd also like the same, please.
There's a very good chance it was James who did that.
Do you still do that as many times a month as you used to?
I wonder what it feels like to be rich.
We beat about for a solution to the problem.
They're here for me.
I was born here in Australia.
I wonder if William and Olivia like doing that.
How old were you when this town had the big fire?
I was watching Joe.
Alex said he'll do that for us if we ask him to.
Wasn't George the first person we called?
Alex didn't mention that he'd met Olivia.
Charlie and Alice promised they'd do that for us.
She's pretty busy herself.
It would be very silly to do that.
Eva got to where she couldn't do that anymore.
Alice is particular about what she watches on TV.
Alex and Alice said they were delighted to do that.
James and Julia are on the balcony.
Mother bought me a new bicycle.
It worked at first.
Has he pressed the blue button?
We are men.
You've got to get out of Boston.
Do you really have everything you need?
He wants a watch just like yours.
We're running out of money.
Harry and Catherine said that they might agree to do that.
He is old and ugly.
This is apparently a good sentence.
Olivia said she wasn't so sure.
Joe is stronger than you, isn't he?
You kill me!
Carmen said she needed a favor.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
You'll be terrific.
Susie is doing her best to stay calm.
If it had not been for his error, we would have won.
Put him on. It's my son.
Aren't you the one who ate my sandwich?
Muhammad knows you can't take care of yourself.
We must deal with the problem instantly.
Joe is the only person who didn't do that.
The owl is slow on foot.
Where's the entrance?
For once in your life, do what I ask.
Charlie says he'll come tomorrow.
I don't think Muhammad knows how much time it'll take to do that.
George offered a different perspective.
Muhammad and I are both single.
I don't think that we need to do that.
Laur posted the picture on her wall.
I just need more time with Tommy.
I think I need to see a doctor.
Keep to these instructions carefully.
The woman who answered the phone spoke French.
She had a copy made of her car key.
You must be blind.
You've already destroyed my career and my reputation. What else do you want?
Please help me in the kitchen.
Who let the dog in?
They put their shoes on the shoe rack.
I would like to exchange money.
George doesn't care about anything.
What part of "Be patient" don't you understand?
I slept for ten hours, nevertheless I'm still tired.
Joe was walking his dog yesterday morning when I saw him.
"I hate you." "I hate you, too."
I hope you have a good lawyer.
William and Anna are very devoted parents.
Would you introduce yourself?
We'll begin the party when Jack and Valentina get here.
I'm waiting.
Lunch was great.
You must work hard if you are to succeed.
Jami could get up to three years in prison.
Bad news travels fast.
What's written in the book?
They hoped that they wouldn't be too late.
This mountain is covered in snow all-year-round.
I thought William and Laur were going to cry.
I was getting a little bored.
I didn't really need to wait for Jack, but I did.
I didn't have the courage to tell her the fact.
They believe in God.
Oliver's family is in Boston.
I don't think that there's any way out of here.
Hi, Susan. How are you?
James took off his sweater.
Jami is still determined to do that.
She tried to express juice from the orange.
We were disappointed with the results of the experiment.
We prayed for Adam.
Don't do it.
Jacob borrowed money to go to college.
Do you know if Alex can come with us tomorrow?
Joe is thirty years old now.
I think it's unlikely Jacob will ask Olivia to do that.
We should inform them about that.
There's apparently no cure for that disease.
Don't forget to reply to her letter.
The piece of cake Alex gave me was so big that I couldn't eat it all.
I'm hope someone will help me do that.
You cannot get blood out of a stone.
Harry asked me to do that quietly.
Harry and I know each other well.
What do you find so interesting about Japan?
Why are you so exhausted?
Someone should look into this.
Charlie didn't let Mary speak French.
Alice walked by and helped Tommy.
Have you decided who you're going to invite?
I don't think that I've ever been here before.
James is not easily satisfied.
I don't know when Harry can do that.
He helped me to get changed.
Who doesn't know this problem?!
I can't get rid of a nasty cold.
I don't want Carmen to find out.
I can't make excuses for you.
Adam discovered that Alice was in trouble and went to help her.
It's because of you that I quit the team.
I'd like to give you a piece of advice.
What did you think of Adam?
That's the next problem we need to solve.
I think Tommy was supposed to be here.
Come here before seven o'clock.
My father has recently returned to Japan.
I am sure it must have slipped your memory.
Jacob took Margaret's suitcase up to her room.
You should eat breakfast every day.
I hope Adam and Margaret don't get embarrassed easily.
James has lived in Australia since then.
There's pay phone in the hall outside George's office.
Jacob can't swim yet.
I had to give Muhammad a little money.
Our son was killed in action.
You can do it, let's go, I'm with you
He told me he was busy.
I don't need a reason.
Tommy said that he wanted to try to do that again.
I told Tommy that I could speak French even though I really couldn't.
Jacob showed us a photo of his mother.
Where would you like to go, sir?
How can you just give up?
We need about five men to lift these heavy cases.
She became a teacher at the age of twenty.
I know what Joe said.
" Wait, isn't this the place we were at a moment ago? " " That's right. We came back. That's strange."
Muhammad isn't likely to be as busy as you think he is.
Relax completely.
There's too many of them!
That sweater looks good on you.
He'll probably do that by himself.
It's taking longer than I thought it would.
Are you sure you're warm enough?
I don't think that I had to do that.
Joe may not be sleepy.
I tell people all the time they should do that.
The ruins are worth visiting.
I'd like to ask a few more questions.
I didn't tell Tommy why I didn't want to do that.
She hasn't yet admitted she did that.
Jacob was in a hurry to get home.
We opposed the plan to build a new road.
I can't believe you aren't planning to do that.
Let me get it.
Stop that thief!
What happened to the rest of the food?
You look very tense.
Use your strength.
She sings out of tune.
We washed the dog.
I know George doesn't know why we need to do that by ourselves.
I'm going to explain all this in more detail later.
I love him, but he lives in another country.
George told Olivia that he thought John was awake.
Please let me know that you're OK.
Jacob says he didn't have a lawyer.
If you want to ask a question, please put your hand up.
We are not on the telephone yet.
They're playing football.
Have you already eaten something?
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Adam knows why Alice is in Australia.
He has gone blind in both eyes.
Adam was worried that someone would discover details about his past.
We hope that you don't ever do that again.
Alex looked pale.
I never want to talk to you again.
Alex and I have a farm not too far from Boston.
They'll do what we tell them to do.
James and I were laughing at you.
I know that you don't know William.
I don't think that Alex will do that today.
It doesn't matter to us if you take a photo from the outside.
Those who don't want to see are very blind.
We're going back home.
Joe took a magazine out of his briefcase and began reading it.
I think that Joe will refuse to do that.
Alex's grades are excellent.
Oscar wasn't a bit tired.
What are you going to do with this money?
Harry served the guests finger food.
Jami said that he didn't know how Carmen did that.
Melanie is eating an apple.
He put the idea into my head.
That could take days.
I'm going to be very late.
George and Eva left through different doors.
Can I call you back?
We had strict rules.
Tommy says he doesn't know who Susie is planning on staying with.
I forgot I have a bad short-term memory.
No one knows where Oliver and Catherine have gone.
Why won't anybody help Alex?
Beef stew should be nice and thick.
You need to stop playing.
Try to be as quiet as possible.
William got Alice to accept his help.
Does she work in this city?
Do you think Jacob might be interested in doing that?
I know Muhammad is a good surgeon, but I'd rather have a surgeon who isn't a close friend.
The disease is still in the primary stage.
Harry and Carmen say that they'll do that on Monday.
I'm not worried about getting fired.
It only took us three hours to get to Boston.
William and Laur can use my computer if they want.
I don't know how Charlie is going to keep his dog from doing that.
Jami was the first person to volunteer to help us do that.
She loves him now more than she did before.
I'm not drunk. I'm as sober as a judge.
I help my mother to cook the food.
I don't think it's very likely that William will want to do that.
Jack didn't know he was being followed.
Jack stuffed a handful of popcorn into his mouth.
It would've been expensive to do that.
Try it.
He forgot to turn off the light.
We've been asked to not do this anymore.
I am ready to die.
Jack was sick in bed for about three months.
Do you realize you could've been killed?
We'll swim tomorrow.
Oliver thought that he was smarter than Susie.
Oliver can't be saved.
Put the book back on the shelf.
Dan continued to steal money from the cash register.
Oscar and Anna may go wherever they want to.
Why don't Adam and Catherine want to go to Boston?
Jami has been studying hard, hasn't he?
They just want to sell papers.
I haven't eaten anything in the past three days.
William is a major in the army.
It seems like William is having a hard time doing that.
How do James and Anna intend to help?
I loved that car.
I kiss my rival, but it is to choke him.
I'll get her right away.
How could I have missed all the clues?
They acted immediately by agreement.
Let's leave when you are ready.
This is the last train, sir.
Where were you in 2013?
She is a shining example of absolutely nothing.
I've had a wonderful time here.
Don't throw rocks into the river.
Margaret wants to buy a car, but she can't afford to.
Oliver accused Catherine of being pig-headed.
He arrived with me.
I was told that you might be able to help me.
I don't think that this movie is interesting.
I often read books.
Joe wants to speak to you.
We should've stopped while we had the chance.
I'm getting a lot better at French.
Tommy said he wanted to visit Emma in the hospital.
I don't know whether I should believe Adam or not.
I regard him as an enemy.
I think we have a chance of winning.
The goal of the practice of medicine is health.
Alex thought Lucy wouldn't see him.
Monica said she didn't help Jami do that.
Oliver isn't home. He's at school.
How much time will it take to do that?
We're being set up.
Could you please tell me how to get to the airport?
How did you know I wanted one of these?
Carmen said she would come to the party.
Your name is on the envelope.
They told me they were unhappy.
James and Valentina have enough money to buy everything they want.
Jack said that he definitely won't be there.
What makes one sad about love, it is not so much to not be loved when you love, but to still be loved when you do not love anymore.
They're not hungry.
Reading is my passion.
That can't be them.
Jami went to Japan to study Japanese.
If it were to rain, he would not go.
Why did you pick that song to sing at Charlie and Laur's wedding?
Harry knows that he can win.
They got excited when they heard that.
I admitted that I wasn't actually the one who did that.
I made a joke about Jacob's accent.
Alex and Anna say that they want to swim.
I didn't give Valentina what she needed.
Students often pursue their teacher with questions.
She said goodbye.
Jacob put his head down on the table.
Tell me who's bothering you.
Adam and Laur said they probably won't do that.
Loud music bothers me.
I forgot to bring the map.
You can count on her.
You have to study English step by step.
Excuse the mess.
The soldier said that death is not to be feared.
You wouldn't want James to do that, would you?
Julia just lost her job.
This novel is interesting enough.
We haven't actually tested that.
I didn't say Oscar was smart.
You knew Oliver didn't plan to do that, didn't you?
I'm a singer.
I don't enjoy doing that as much as I used to.
The only thing that matters to Muhammad is how much money he makes.
You may have to do that.
I feel like I can't do enough.
You must be busy.
Listen and repeat each sentence.
Tell me what you told him.
She said she wasn't feeling well.
Joe saw Eva, but didn't say anything to her.
Please tell me about your problems.
Please enjoy your stay at this hotel.
I wasn't thirsty.
You should tell George that he has to be more careful the next time he does that.
Dan received a note from Linda asking him to meet her outside.
Everybody got something.
Muhammad can't find his bag.
Carmen said that she wasn't having any fun.
Joe has always been one of the best players on our team.
Alex's father isn't as old as Mary's father.
If I were a flower, I'd be a rose.
Harry is married to a doctor.
We need to follow him.
It's only a matter of time.
Perhaps you've made a mistake.
Are we doing this?
I wonder if Oscar knows where my umbrella is.
He called him.
I spent a lot of time in Australia.
I think both of them are right.
That's your pride talking.
Let's get the show on the road.
How much do the transmission rights come to?
Alice is still in love with her ex-boyfriend.
I'm afraid that'll happen.
Jack was screaming and yelling.
Jack and Julia said they thought John was the best singer in their class.
Catherine loves her work.
James was laid off.
I didn't think that it would take so long time to do that.
I thought that I heard a thud.
Jami has decided to become a teacher.
Which one is mine?
Laur never seems to have any money on her.
I know that William hadn't yet done that.
Charlie has to let me do this.
She told me she was done.
Mary cut the rope with her knife.
This game is easy.
The history course is interesting.
How many hours does it take to fly to Boston?
Eva invited Oscar and his sister to her party.
I'm remembering when we were kids.
The apples look good.
James and Julia say that they saw something strange.
Oscar had difficulty convincing Lucy to help him.
He comes round once a week.
You're just wasting our time.
Why don't we go dancing?
The green color becomes Alice.
I am very afraid to go.
Jami told me that I need to be at today's meeting.
You may have a slight fever.
Oscar says he doesn't think Monica really needs to do that.
My house is far away.
I'm afraid that I have internal bleeding.
Joe wasn't the one who told Margaret where John lived.
I met up with her on the street.
Alex and Eva said that they had a lot of fun.
Jami wishes that were true.
Every time I listen to this song, I cry.
I thought that you said you were going to buy me a drink.
The road goes north from here.
I've spoken to Adam and he's OK.
Charlie and Monica are good baseball players.
He could not make head or tail of it.
Tommy can't go to Australia with me.
That artist's very popular.
She likes to play with her dogs.
I thought that you were older than me.
Julia said she had to wait for Muhammad.
You should listen to your teacher.
Jacob would never hurt me.
She wouldn't let us help her.
You'll find a solution, I'm sure.
Didn't you know Tommy was still a high school student?
Jacob gave Lucy a high five.
I just want to find Joe.
Where can I go to get a map of Europe?
You'd better call Adam.
Am I the only one who thinks this is strange?
Do you really think George and Mary are rich?
My throat feels dry.
I don't like fried fish.
You used to be so cool.
This isn't just about Joe.
She got to the hotel late at night.
William and Susie were walking too fast for me keep up with them.
Julia said she wouldn't want to try doing that without some help.
If you look deep enough you will see music; the heart of nature being everywhere music.
"Did you kiss him?" "Yes, I kissed him."
I wonder why Oliver and Eva need to be finished doing that by 2:30.
He got me wrong.
George didn't blame anybody but himself.
Hey, that's not our problem.
Do you really think you can do this?
His ambition is to be first.
Charlie and Eva are just leaving.
After a while, he came.
I wish somebody had told me earlier.
You're not like anybody else I know.
I'm the only student in our class who can speak French.
My mom married my dad in the 90s.
How do you know how deep the lake is?
Here is my album.
Even though Joe didn't want to go to the party, he went because he thought he'd see Eva there.
You won't be needing that where you're going.
How did you do?
I fooled everybody.
Dan served only 15 years of his sentence and is now free, living in London with his daughter, Linda.
Jack suggested to Susie that she apologize to John.
I know I probably don't say it often enough, but I love you.
Is there something in your room you don't want me to see?
My father, who is now working in the United States, wrote us a letter last week.
I know that Jacob doesn't know he isn't supposed to do that.
I thought a lot about what you said.
Alex can't be all that young.
We aren't on the list.
It would be better to agree to the terms.
Does it have a pulse?
I don't think things will change anytime soon.
This is a really good hospital.
I know that James has done that before.
He brought me coffee, when I had asked for tea.
Emma has just lost her job.
She could change her mind.
He was sitting on his mother's lap.
Don't you never do that again!
Jami stopped walking.
Could you please tell me how much this costs?
In the war, many people died young.
James works at a local restaurant.
People don't visit Boston as often as they used to.
I haven't called them back.
I stayed with a friend of mine.
Dude, seriously.
I am not convinced that this is the case.
Such an accurate, lightning-quick reply. What can I say?
Sit down with me.
Joe knows that I'm not going win.
Did you like the movie that you went to yesterday?
This is a dangerous place to be.
Oscar turned down the radio.
She was truly satisfied.
I shall be delighted to see you again.
I want to go abroad, for instance, to Italy and Spain.
Tommy told me he cried.
I suppose I'd better go.
Adam claims that he saw the accident.
Where's the ice?
I'm the one who said we should take a break.
I don't think Jacob will have to do that by himself.
I wish to God I had done as Alex suggested.
I appreciate this.
I have socks, but I have no shoes.
What were you and Joe fighting about?
Julia refused to admit that she'd made a mistake.
"Has anybody done that?" "No, not yet."
Are you going home anytime soon?
Reality can be beaten with enough imagination.
Oscar knew that Margaret thought John and Alice were going to get married.
What you say now isn't consistent with what you said before.
It is not appropriate for you to do this.
You're being ridiculous.
Can Jack do that for us?
She will be there by now.
I understand what's said and written, but it's hard for me to speak.
Please tell Monica that she's required to do that.
Why did you choose this spot to build your house?
I saw George out of the corner of my eye.
We're staying at another hotel.
Everyone needs to stay focused.
I wish I hadn't let Joe do that.
What's the date?
Tell Jacob he can't go.
We threw her out.
I don't think Adam will be busy tomorrow.
I don't think Oscar was expecting you to do that.
Guests began arriving a little after 2:30.
I don't like that kind of cake.
She cried when I told her.
I can't find a pair of shoes that fit.
William left the building.
George and I wanted to be together all the time when we were younger.
Anna injured herself this morning.
I met her only once.
The battle lasted a week.
I'm 27.
I published my little book in 2001.
They don't want him back.
I leave for Paris tomorrow.
I wonder why I shouldn't do that.
It might not just be a coincidence.
Silk is soft and smooth.
Harry ate the stew straight from the pot.
Everybody except Oliver knew that he didn't have to go to Australia.
Have you ever been in Brazil?
I don't believe we've officially met.
Oliver lost money at the casino, but he told his friends he'd won.
I didn't know how bad it was.
You do know that you shouldn't be doing that here, don't you?
I'm the one who convinced George to do that.
Let's move on to the next order of business.
I think that James would be able to convince Anna to stop doing that.
You haven't seen my keys, have you?
Oliver said he wished that Alice would win.
I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble.
Don't let such a good opportunity go by.
The weekend went by too fast.
They always carry books with them.
Muhammad doesn't seem to be as popular as Anna seems to be.
I walked here.
Please make sure Muhammad knows what he's supposed to do.
Jacob can't deny it anymore.
James is going to change the rules.
Men are pigs.
How many kids does she have?
Muhammad will be going back to Australia soon.
Lucy had her hair cut yesterday.
You've already given me enough money.
I don't want someone else. I want you.
Is there a clock in one of the rooms?
He made up his mind to buy the car.
Say "hi" to Oliver for me.
How safe is this part of the city?
They said that they weren't single.
William really wanted to go to Boston with Mary.
I haven't eaten breakfast today.
William told me that the medicine he was taking didn't seem to help.
Both Jack and I can drive.
Jack forgot to ask Laur what he had planned to ask her.
I think Jacob and Valentina do that well.
I can see how beautiful Melanie is.
I doubt that Jami really likes doing that very much.
Let's chuck it.
Tommy told me that he'd decided to do that.
Do Alex and Mary have any medical problems?
He broke his new toy.
Alex says he's done that.
I'll stop smoking from tomorrow.
George died in bed.
There are a lot of idiots here tonight.
Catherine died giving birth to her second son.
Oliver was the manager before me.
I might go shopping tomorrow, but I'm not sure yet.
She didn't even say thanks.
Jack said that the team needed a new captain.
They claimed that they've done that.
Money has to serve, not to rule.
Muhammad doesn't think he can stop Alice from doing that.
Did you happen to be present when the accident happened?
George hasn't left Australia.
What kind of activities do you like to do in your free time?
I knew where Muhammad and Carmen were.
He realized he needed to do that.
Jacob said he thought Monica was difficult to get along with.
I have nothing to do now.
I thought that was what we were supposed to do.
It couldn't be this simple, could it?
I know that Jack doesn't know why I didn't want to do that.
Susie ended up taking the job that they offered her.
I thought you wanted to get married.
How did you feel when that happened?
Humans are greedy.
Is there something you wanted to tell me?
I'm sorry, but I didn't catch what you said.
Nothing was working.
Yes, I certainly agree.
You're too good for her.
Add up these figures.
You're asking the wrong person.
I did everything by myself.
George has been studying really hard.
I'll go to Boston even if Oliver doesn't go.
I'm sure that Alex will be delighted to see you.
How are you going to tell him?
We were all surprised that Alex didn't win the race.
He said he had a knife in his car.
Joe reached into the sack and pulled out some coins.
I think I will take a vacation this week.
Joe was wrong as usual.
Sometimes we donât do things we want to do so that others wonât know we want to do them.
I know that William has never done that.
I'm no longer living in Boston.
You know this isn't the way we should be doing this.
I didn't think Jami would like it.
How does that help?
Let's make the world a better place.
I know that Jack isn't a professional basketball player anymore.
A button came off my coat.
I wouldn't hurt Jack.
You look like a policeman.
William and Laur aren't as cute as they used to be.
Oscar seems to like the same kind of music as Alice.
I don't think that Tommy would do this.
Monica isn't as healthy as she used to be.
Everybody was staring at her.
This is not a sentence.
I'll keep my fingers crossed that everything will go well for you today.
She took us all in with her smile.
He refused to answer my question.
Just go and get some rest.
Jack is a forensic expert.
Alex thinks some of his friends will do that.
What do you want to do Monday evening?
Charlie is going to be even better next time.
Adam and Anna wrote a song together.
They got scared and killed Jack.
Charlie knew what Mary was trying to do.
I tried to get some sleep.
Charlie said that it was Olivia who told him he should do that.
I thought that Oliver already knew.
I do serve you in this business.
I'm positive that James can do that.
We shouldn't tell them anything.
I'm pretty good at first aid.
He won the prize this day week.
Some days I have too many conversations with too many people. I can't remember who said what.
I'm shorter than him.
I think you should find out when Adam plans to leave.
Adam was so angry at Carmen he couldn't even look at her.
Joe says he intended to do that.
I tried to swim across the river.
Charlie is probably still the one responsible for getting that done.
I was surprised you won the prize.
He told me he's nervous.
Life is more and more expensive.
He's the man of the house.
Do you know what's really going on between Alex and Emma?
I wish I could give you something.
What country is Boston in?
I used to dream about being married to you.
Get on top of me.
I am afraid she is ill.
William was able to live a more or less normal life after the operation.
They communicate with each other by mail.
I'll tell Jack as soon as he comes.
Let me make sure I have this straight.
It's about 30 minutes from here on foot.
I'll take care of the matter personally.
My wife's father is my father-in-law.
Alex said that he thought that I was the only one who wanted to do that.
I saw him caught by the police.
We're a great big happy family.
Jami said that Lucy isn't sure whether John can do that.
Charlie wondered how many times Julia had been arrested.
Where did she get these?
Perhaps not.
Why don't you go home?
Jack called in sick today.
Julia gave Joe all her money.
Do you think that we'll find her house?
Laur said she hoped Adam would eat what she made.
I have met this girl before.
Charlie is wearing a cool-looking hat.
I'm going to ask Charlie to never do that again.
This is where my father works.
In a war of ideas it is people who get killed.
Harry decided to go back home.
That's a little hard to believe.
We're planning to stay for a few days.
You have some money, don't you?
I know Tommy will be prepared to do that.
It looks like I'm on my own.
I was tired today.
I took her order and went back to the kitchen.
You must face the facts.
My father says he failed in the entrance examination twice.
You should be through doing that by now.
I was very surprised when Oliver told me Catherine had left Australia.
She covered her face.
You should've visited Australia.
Oscar has started dating again.
Do you two know each other?
I think that Jami should talk to me.
You were almost killed.
That was so fun.
What is it, Catherine? What's wrong?
George wasn't the one who told me Catherine didn't need to do that.
He went to Italy for the purpose of studying music.
I'd like to do shopping on Fifth Avenue in New York.
I wonder if Charlie is still upset.
I hope they're going to be OK.
We had a long discussion as to what to do about it.
My license has been suspended.
I can't tell you how many times I've thought about all the good times we used to have together.
Joe doesn't carry much cash.
What's Jack accused me of doing now?
Oliver seemed to take a liking to her.
I was arrested last week.
They denied they laughed.
Is the seat high?
I don't really enjoy doing playing games on my phone.
How could this have happened?
James said that no one else was there.
I know that Alex is guilty.
Harry and Julia couldn't find anyone to give them a ride home.
William is too shy to talk to girls.
We sometimes meet in the park.
I know that Harry and Olivia are famous.
I guess I have nothing to lose.
Oliver was reported missing Monday.
I think Joe has the ability to solve his problems on his own.
Oliver told me he was planning to study abroad.
I made Adam and Anna go there by themselves.
Did Muhammad say anything about where he had been?
Monica didn't have anything in her bag.
I knew that William was a very good chess player.
They all turned and looked at Muhammad.
The pilot lost control and the plane went into a dive.
I bought many books today so I put them in order.
Will William be able to do that for us?
Will Harry be willing to do that?
She arrived on time. I arrived in time.
I really want to die already.
The collection of taxes is well organized.
Jami is your buddy.
Monica definitely knows her stuff.
He took off his watch.
He's the group leader.
Don't make me regret telling you who I really am.
I want to see my friends in Canada.
Please show me the list.
I didn't bring that matter up at the meeting.
Every mistake made me stronger.
He met many fascinating people in the course of his travels.
We can only abuse of things that are good.
What's your favorite Christmas movie?
Tommy and Anna promised John that they'd eat whatever he cooked.
You filthy beast, get out of here!
Jacob is a very friendly guy.
That is not exactly the way that it happened.
Joe and Alice found several T-shirts they liked.
My friend wants milk.
I can't find my ticket. I must've lost it.
Jacob sent me a thank you note.
I proved the fact on the strength of the data.
He has an interesting book.
It makes you look younger.
This is too bright.
Does anyone on your staff speak French?
James wasn't surprised Anna was afraid.
I suspect Oliver did it on purpose.
It was to a great extent his own fault.
Just act like nothing happened.
I thought that George should get more exercise.
She was dressed all in white for the wedding.
Oliver found them.
We don't need money.
She has yet to answer any of the questions.
I gave an answer that was way out in left field when the teacher caught me off-guard and called on me.
She knew what she was getting into.
Charlie was a junior high school student when I first met him.
They expected to win.
I wonder how much we'll have to pay.
Things are bad.
What kind of pizza do you like best?
Muhammad arrived home to find that Margaret had packed her things and left.
I should've known it was a waste of time.
She looks blue for some reason.
Good job, Captain Obvious.
Alex is a pretty smart guy.
Oliver told Monica that she should quit pretending to be upset.
Since this morning I've read three books.
I counted the days to see when it had happened.
Don't forget to tell Harry what time the meeting's going to start.
Your friend is tired.
I haven't been out in ages.
I have never thought of that.
They hate this idea, don't they?
Adam opened the door and listened before he decided to walk in.
That isn't why I'm afraid of Jacob.
Muhammad probably can't speak French.
When I woke up, there were four inches of snow on the ground.
Is his short story any good?
Laur has gotten her confidence back.
Harry and Julia wanted to see the same movie.
I think Jami and Eva are sick of me.
Before long she will come back to the stage.
I couldn't let Muhammad know the truth.
Didn't you know Adam and Julia both like watching baseball on TV?
Do you really want to risk that?
Harry's parents left him very little money.
I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.
Iâm sorry, Iâm really bad with names â what was yourâs again?
I don't think Harry would let me drive his new sports car.
It wasn't much of a fight.
I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I think that James would like to be the next one to do that.
They pay Jami a lot to do that.
A war exploded between the two countries.
He is not just interested, he's crazy about it.
Joe already knows that we want to talk to Julia.
You can wear anything you want.
The teacher has no authority with his students.
The politician was removed from office.
I didn't want to see her.
He said that he was feeling great.
Carmen told William that she used to live in Boston.
Our store isn't open on Thanksgiving.
I can't imagine myself ever being in the mood for that kind of thing.
John is better loved than his father.
It looks good on paper.
I got held up at the office.
Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.
Why did Joe come to see you today?
I like putting machines together.
I thought that I told you not to call Joe at school.
I'm sorry things didn't work out between you two.
What's the most beautiful city in Germany?
Cast your vote for me!
Harry started an advertising agency.
How are you two getting along?
Come again next week.
How could Oliver say no?
I'm really, really excited.
I wonder whether we could do anything to help.
Choose books carefully.
He drew an apple.
You are responsible for the death of the child.
When will you get ready to leave?
What movie are you watching?
"You tell jokes like Muhammad." "What's that supposed to mean?" "They're just not funny."
We're expecting Tommy to help us.
I made the final decision.
Monica made Alex tell her everything.
Tell him I have some questions for her.
Everybody had changed so much that I could hardly tell one from another.
George has more than enough money to buy a car.
Carmen seemed surprised when I told her I wanted to do that.
Adam really made you happy, didn't he?
My mother has been dead these ten years.
Let's sit down in the shade of that tree.
I'm afraid that he has already gone out.
Charlie said he wanted to drink some milk.
Do you want our help or don't you?
Oliver and Monica are ready to move on.
Tommy says that Laur isn't good at doing that.
Joe may go to Australia next summer.
We assumed James and Julia were alone.
Jami and Anna don't like the houses that they live in.
William added up the numbers.
Do you think she's innocent?
Could you exchange it with another one?
She said she isn't happy.
I've been trying to find him.
We communicate with each other by telephone every day.
I wish we could live here.
Something bad happened to William.
Do you want sugar or milk?
She always had a smile on her face.
They're looking for you.
Valentina says she doesn't have enough time.
George is still skinny.
The couple named their first child Mark.
When did Oscar buy that coat?
To begin with, this is a lie.
What are you laughing at? It's a fact. No kidding!
Here, I'll help you out.
Monica doesn't know how to say what she wants to say in French.
James and Mary decided that they'd never try doing that again.
You seem to recognize me.
It was more difficult than I thought it would be.
Jacob's only got eyes for Alice.
Jami and Carmen are going to need more room.
I love my dad.
Do you want to get drunk?
May I get ready?
Muhammad said that he won't sing tonight.
Neither Jack nor Lucy has been studying French very long.
Lucy isn't going to help, is she?
I got three questions wrong on today's test.
It gave her quite a shock, and she didn't want to talk about anything for a while. I think it'll be a while before she's back to normal.
I absolutely agree with you.
I'm asking you to respect my decision.
Oliver and Laur aren't going to make it, are they?
Oliver and Monica said they don't smoke anymore.
I'm not entirely convinced that what Tommy said is true.
You can eat this.
I haven't had dinner yet.
I'm pretty sure that Tommy doesn't want to go to Boston with Mary.
Jami has just returned from Australia.
She covered her eyes.
Jami wants you to go to Australia with him.
Are you Russian?
Tommy promised Lucy a lot of jewelry, but he never gave her any.
He wrote me a letter.
The first time they met me, they already invited me to stay with them for Christmas.
Alex solved the mystery.
Tell him I'll be there by 2:30.
My new baby arrived!
Tommy said he didn't think he'd have enough time to do that today.
I wish I didn't have to do that this week.
You can easily find Muhammad's house.
I'm sure Harry won't be in Australia now.
Jacob is making more money this year than last year.
Alex is usually a lot nicer than Eva.
Jami and Margaret said that they wanted to move to Boston because that's where John lives.
I want to go round to see Adam.
Oscar told me that he thought it would snow all day.
My doctor told me that drinking a little wine every day would be good for me.
