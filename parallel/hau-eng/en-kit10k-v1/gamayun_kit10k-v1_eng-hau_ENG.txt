Alex is very much like his father.
Registration closes this month.
Charlie told Anna that he wanted to leave early.
George promised that he'd wait for us.
Jami is on the front porch.
Apparently, Laur had a lot on her mind, so I just left her alone.
Do you remember the day when you and I first met?
There are several reasons why I don't want to do that.
William told me that he was planning to leave his wife.
I'll try to find out why Oscar and Eva did that the way they did it.
I wasn't wearing a coat.
Jacob hasn't been able to go to school for three weeks.
Why don't you share your candy with Oscar?
I saw something terrible.
Your trousers are dirty.
Why is the child alone? Where is his mother?
That car could have hit me.
This is a list of things we need to buy.
Oscar is a very frank person.
I wish I knew what you're looking for.
I was hoping I could get a little help.
I remember singing that song long ago.
I'm going to allow Susie to do whatever she wants.
Do you want me to tell Adam that we won't do that?
Tell Jami how you found out that he did that.
Tommy is very emotional.
It isn't that I don't care, I just don't care as much as you do.
I should've done that the way you suggested.
Harry said that he thought that you'd probably do that.
James took a week off.
Neither of us will be in Boston next month.
George isn't a young guy anymore.
We sat on a bench in the park.
Did Oliver and Emma say when they'd arrive?
Writing news stories is his job.
She came here once again.
Jacob told Julia to stop the car.
She abandoned her sons.
You've played.
Oscar and Susie are so cool.
George got tired of reading and wanted to go outside and play.
I imagine a house in which I would be happy.
I take a nap almost every day.
It's okay. I won't bite.
When will dinner be ready? I'm terribly hungry.
He doesn't live in my neighborhood.
Jack doesn't know if Alice wants to do that or not.
I don't think we should hang around.
Who did she have in mind?
You need to stop drinking.
Don't lie to us.
Jacob said Olivia was asked to do that.
That'll never do.
I will answer for his honesty.
We are players.
Adam wrote a tragedy with a happy ending.
George gave no reason for his decision.
I hope that we can make friends in Australia.
I promise to leave you alone.
Oscar will have to do that next week.
Jack isn't worried about Alice.
The new plan will call for a lot of money.
He had enough wisdom to refuse the offer.
Do you know how that happened?
Harry sleeps here.
It is our duty to keep our town clean.
I know Adam is a very important member of our team.
I can't find Eva. I think she must've gone home.
This is the village where he was born.
Exchange the old part for a new one.
Confirm the order.
The American people aren't stupid.
She says she finished doing that.
I thought that you said that you had been asked to do that.
I need to do that.
William said that he'd also help Valentina do that.
I am of the opinion that this is the way to do it.
I cannot understand the physics teacher. I am completely lost!
I wonder whether Muhammad and Emma are serious.
Do you want me to open the box?
She said she's prepared.
Would you leave me alone?
William suggested we leave early.
I know James knows you don't really have to do that.
You've got my attention.
Harry said he had nothing to hide.
Our city sits on an active fault.
I have not been busy since yesterday.
Thanks, I understood everything.
I live in a house that was built in 2013.
No matter what happens, I'm not changing my mind.
I couldn't help Charlie do what he was trying to do.
This company was established in 1930.
Why didn't you tell me that you didn't know what to do?
Television is ruining family life.
Our house has already burned down twice.
The train we rode was a high-speed train.
It's so slow.
I didn't begin to study French until I was thirty years old.
Who else came to the party?
What would you like to see?
It was too difficult.
Oscar did warn you.
She was overcome with emotion.
I almost fell off the cliff.
I knew Jacob was the one who was supposed to tell Olivia she needs to do that.
I went to Italy for the second time in 1980.
I swear I don't know anything.
Many couples end in divorce.
Ask at the police station over there.
When is your birthday?
I know that I have to help you tomorrow.
You guys need to calm down.
My teeth hurt.
James knows that he could've done that better.
She locked a door.
It's hard to lose somebody like Jami.
I don't think that Tommy is rich.
It's a miracle! The link works!
Charlie wasn't the first one to say we shouldn't do that.
Should I buy it?
That must have happened while I was in Boston.
I'm getting older and I don't want to work at night anymore.
There's no need for name calling.
You're not going to tell anyone about this, right?
Nothing appears to be missing.
A lot of people I know live in Boston.
He is free from money worry.
Oscar isn't in Boston anymore.
It's a huge responsibility.
Jacob says that he'll do that today.
Do you two often argue?
What's your favorite place to go hear live music?
Yes, that's our manager.
It's not a secret that Adam's opinion is different than yours.
That doesn't mean Joe is satisfied.
A good coach is like a father to his players.
Jacob thinks that Valentina wouldn't likely do that.
Why don't you come in out of the cold?
I'm your neighbor.
They deserve to be remembered.
Jami and Catherine tried to persuade their father to let them go to Boston by themselves.
Don't try doing two things at the same time.
I'll bet Jacob doesn't get here on time.
I learned a lot about Australia from Jami.
She could not help but think about him.
I wouldn't like to live there.
I stopped the video.
I'd go to Boston if I had the chance.
Do you trust Jack now?
Jacob didn't seem excited.
I know that George doesn't know that he shouldn't be doing that.
That's a little unfair.
They finished their meal.
He came at about four o'clock.
I need a miracle.
They said that they'd be early.
No one came to Jacob's rescue.
We're here for the day.
I'm going to go back to the office.
Can't you understand?
I promised Harry I'd play tennis with him.
I remember the year when he got a job.
All of us like them.
Charlie is often traveling.
I've had a look around.
When we experience darkness, we are facing away from the sun. When we experience daylight, we are facing the sun.
If you hadn't had advice, you'd have failed.
Bill is the smarter of the two brothers.
You have a good reputation.
She said that she was mad.
I owe what I am today to my uncle.
Why do children do that?
We need to take a break from each other.
I never called him an idiot.
No one has ever told me that before.
I'm going to get something to drink.
She stood up for what was right.
The animals were busy collecting nuts.
I don't even want you there.
I hate my voice.
Did you see her stare at that young man?
Don't test me.
Muhammad was here earlier this evening.
Eventually, someone's going to have to tell Charlie and Julia that they need to behave themselves.
There are way too many people in this room.
Do you know how to get to our place?
Tell me the reason why you were late for school.
Because of a serious disease, he can't move his body as most people can.
One of those people may be her.
Why did you just do that?
Have you kissed her?
He's now short of money.
Yesterday the teacher said to us, "I'll give you a test tomorrow."
It never pays to lie.
Everybody except Joe seemed to be having fun.
This room is full of sun.
Oscar will do the right thing.
Jacob said that he wasn't ready to go home yet.
I want to apologize for what I did.
It's dangerous to pass by the bridge.
Adam knows everyone is waiting for him.
She tried to cut her own hair.
We know William is in there.
Let me have a look at it.
It's more dangerous than I thought.
Eva says she thinks she won't win.
Why are William and Margaret afraid to do that?
I left my umbrella here last week.
This key doesn't work.
We cannot know too much about the language we speak every day of our lives.
I can't be late today.
I should have invited Tommy, but I didn't.
You're lucky you didn't get busted.
I have just returned from the post office.
I expect to be paid for this work by tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've seen snow?
Yeah. That'd be great.
I really want to kiss you.
Harry doesn't spend enough time studying.
You're a really good cook.
I had nothing to do with William.
Oliver wasn't the one who borrowed my car.
The Pope visited Brazil.
I guess I should've read it more carefully.
We saw her last night.
Allow me to introduce myself.
They got married when they were still young.
I know you told me when you'd be coming, but I couldn't get there then.
I don't think that you'd do that.
I want Muhammad to help Eva.
He had the cheek to ask me to help him.
Why don't we go camping together?
I'm wise.
She thinks that she's a good driver.
I thought that you said you enjoyed doing that.
He says he believes he can win.
What kind of music do you listen to most often?
He that stays in the valley shall never get over the hill.
This tastes like chicken.
I'll give you a chance.
He tore up the letter in tears.
I look forward to seeing you again soon.
Catherine should've been ready, but she wasn't.
Jacob says he can't remember his French teacher's name.
What does that mean in Arabic?
This bus can carry fifty passengers.
What are you smiling about?
William works here, too.
I haven't kissed Adam in a long time.
I don't have a choice. I have to do it.
He and I stayed at the hotel.
I want to see them!
Alex opened his eyes and didn't immediately realize that he was in a hospital room.
Harry likely won't laugh.
Oscar showed me how to do that.
These seem interesting.
One more hour and the turkey will be ready.
Tommy said he just got back from Australia.
They're really big.
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
They say I have a way with words.
William came home for the Thanksgiving weekend.
I know Oscar will never agree to do that.
"Did you tell her everything?" "No way, I barely touched the subject."
Jack knew I was home.
I didn't like the PM's speech.
I don't know why Muhammad isn't here today.
It was time for lunch.
He is kind rather than gentle.
When was the last time you stayed at a hotel?
Can you help me dial? The telephone is put too high.
Blessed for not making me a woman.
James thought Anna didn't like cats.
Jacob does whatever we ask him to do.
I'm so sorry about yesterday.
I was told you'd be willing to help.
Our daughter is none the better because we've been nursing.
Harry often stays out late.
What's it really worth?
It is hard to determine the distance.
He felt the rain on his face.
He just doesn't get it.
You should have told me that before.
I cannot take a rest at the office. I don't want the manager to see me.
The box is almost empty.
I don't have to go there unless I want to.
George doesn't live here in Australia.
Adam is handsome.
George will need one of these.
Doing that would be dangerous.
Do you really expect Oscar to arrive on time?
They said that they were curious.
Oscar goes to a restaurant for lunch at least three times a week.
Jacob is Lucy's adopted brother.
The voice acting is horrible.
Doing that wouldn't be the right thing to do.
I could fix that, I think.
Go!
Are you traveling alone?
Jacob went to the park on Sunday afternoon.
Harry has found a way to make a little extra money.
Charlie is reading a book in his room.
Tommy asked Emma not to discuss the matter with anyone else.
I wonder if Jack was arrested.
Valentina is quite strong, isn't she?
Jami is nicer to me than Susie is.
I keep a gun in my home.
We have to wait here for Adam.
Joe should have been able to do that without Valentina's help.
I know Adam didn't have to do that, but he did it anyway.
Joe really wanted to go yesterday evening.
Joe went down the stairs.
I have homework to finish.
We're going sailing on Monday.
Oscar always keeps Margaret's picture in his wallet.
I needed to stay in Australia longer than I thought I would need to.
I may not know a lot, but I do know Oliver doesn't know what he's talking about.
We don't trust William.
Does Harry often go drinking with Valentina?
Margaret said she hopes Muhammad will win.
The table and the bed stood in their former places.
Susie wasn't the first one who said she'd like to do that.
There's a rock on the floor.
You're not going to tell my parents, are you?
I don't yet know what Alex wants to do.
Have you ever worn long underwear?
Better to be alone than in bad company.
Alex didn't need to go there himself.
What sort of man is Muhammad Jackson?
Several weeks later, Muhammad was dead.
He said that he wasn't rich.
I'm going to go see George.
To our disappointment, our team lost the game.
Over here!
Here are the gifts.
Tomorrow is Sunday.
William is in his room sleeping, isn't he?
Jacob says that Lucy definitely wanted to go with us, so we should wait.
Did you know Adam wasn't happy here?
I don't think that I should do that inside.
Oliver was very spoiled.
I hope to sell my house for $300,000.
The boy almost drowned.
Why am I so sleepy?
Do you hate your neighbor?
What are you two going to talk about?
I like the dog.
Jacob thought Margaret wouldn't likely come to his party.
He sings very well.
I can't live on ten thousand yen a month.
Joe's homeless.
The wind he gave off smells.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I knew that Jack wouldn't lose.
Alex wasn't able to find Carmen a good job.
Valentina is still working here, isn't she?
What use are you to me?
Adam would do that if you asked him to.
Adam and Margaret can't have done that by themselves.
I slept on the plane for a couple of hours.
Jami told me last week he was going to Boston next week.
We came together to form a group.
He fried himself some eggs.
We're going to keep doing this until someone tells us that we can't.
How many do you have left?
Do you happen to know when Oliver is coming?
That's our town's oldest building, and it must be kept no matter what.
Jami put his arm around the young woman.
They looked terrible.
Why don't you and Charlie do that together?
Muhammad felt like a new man.
Can't you stay here with us?
I don't think Jami is sure that's what Alice wants to do.
I know it's still there.
I still don't think that that's going to happen.
I didn't know that until this morning.
I believe that we can do that.
Tommy likes helping others.
Tommy suggested going to Boston for the summer.
Make an appointment.
Stop going there.
He opened the door.
Emma went to sleep happy.
Do you love your husband?
Jami is a nice kid.
I will speak to her alone.
Julia said that she thought George was getting tired.
I don't think that Jack knows what Anna is planning on doing.
Were you wearing clothes?
Joe is going to come back the day after tomorrow.
Charlie was a typical teenager.
Jami said that he thought my plan wouldn't work.
Eva did say that she didn't want to go with us.
I did that once when I was a student.
He agreed to what they said.
Joe probably doesn't know he isn't likely to be punished.
They said that they'd go there tomorrow.
I'd really like to know why you don't like Oscar.
What's your impression of George?
I can continue to do that if you want me to.
Muhammad told me that he thought Olivia was better at French than he was.
Margaret told me she probably wouldn't do that.
Muhammad knows where he can find me.
Oliver can't afford to buy a car.
I sort of doubt it.
Jacob was very drunk.
I have been reading the book all afternoon.
Alex says that he has to borrow some money.
I'm surprised you couldn't remember that.
Harry heard an explosion and ran outside to see what had happened.
I know that James knew he shouldn't have done that.
I want to purchase property in Australia.
It's a waste of time to do that.
If you go there once, you'll know.
Her husband is about to die.
I won't tell anyone about her.
She was pleased to be treated as a guest.
I want you to let Alex live.
I'll do that as soon as possible.
We have two daughters.
I can only speak French.
You've done time, haven't you?
Are you there, Muhammad?
That's a question that I can answer.
I just want to see him.
You're so strong.
I got very sick.
I know the potential consequences.
I'll be having lunch with James.
I take a shower every day.
William just kept winning.
Joe isn't a bad singer.
Joe clearly doesn't want to be here.
I guess that's about it.
I flew on a Tokyo-bound plane.
Why don't you fix James something to eat?
Alex and Monica said that they'd be there.
Adam wanted Monica to talk to John about the problem she was having with his children.
Charlie definitely drank more than Monica did last night.
I thought that I'd be able to get home by 2:30.
He could not help but think about her.
I don't see any significant difference.
They are breaking down the wall.
They are to hold a party tonight.
Oscar and Emma said they remembered seeing John do that.
Oscar and Alice should tell John they won't go to Boston with him.
She never drinks with her students.
I cared little for his opinion.
I know that Jami is a very generous man.
You should carry out your first plan.
It's loose.
It's starting to snow.
Do your parents speak French?
Every night, she stays up until her husband returns home.
She started running her fingers through her hair.
This is definitely, 'The good you do for others is good you do yourself'! It's a reward because I was helpful!
I suspect you know why I'm here today.
Oliver says he finished doing that.
I don't intend to go to Boston with you.
Give Tommy everything we've got.
You didn't tell Jacob what you wrote to Catherine, did you?
Let me know if anything strange happens.
I have some questions to ask you.
"I'll pay you." "I'm not doing this for money."
I didn't understand half of what she was saying.
I don't think that Joe is the person you should be talking to.
German is the best language in the world.
Harry took the easy way out.
Joe is kissing Susie now.
This box is a different colour to that one.
She arrived there before Joe.
I think cute girls probably look cute no matter what they wear.
May I quote you?
George is the best friend I've ever had.
Charlie told me that he thought that Mary was ambitious.
It should be possible to change that.
Jack is quite greedy.
He'll be asleep.
I didn't have any fun doing that.
George wanted everybody to know he was unhappy.
I just want you and me to be happy.
He sacrificed everything for you.
I will make a bargain with you.
I hope that that's enough.
Jack didn't want to help us today.
Are you speaking English?
Joe probably doesn't yet know he's got to do that today.
James disappeared into thin air.
Jack and Monica are three hours behind schedule.
We're going to get married in October.
I didn't really enjoy being in Australia.
Is he all right?
I knew I should've married you.
I still have many clear memories of my school days.
Why don't you let Oliver know you can take care of yourselves?
Joe didn't realize who that was.
Do you need a ride home?
Where did Harry get that much money?
Is she a friend?
Tommy said that he thought Catherine wasn't asleep.
I'd be surprised if Harry and Margaret don't do that.
I played basketball last year.
The job was difficult, but Harry still wanted to do it.
Oliver and Alice both retired when they were 65 years old.
I don't feel like doing anything when it's that hot.
I haven't yet decided what to do.
I'm going to spend the weekend in Boston.
Oliver said that he thought there was no chance that Eva would do that by herself.
I assume you two know each other.
I know Muhammad will be allowed to do that today.
We're digging a well in the backyard.
Do you have needle and thread?
Cows live on grass.
You're in the wrong seat.
You should've asked Muhammad first.
Harry is dark and handsome.
Adam's a rich kid.
Tell me who you thought I was.
I'm not sure that I can win this.
"Has he broken up with you?" "Yes, and now my heart is heavy as lead".
Retire.
There's a good chance James will be punished for what he did.
Olivia said that she was upset.
She drew her gun and said:
George will do that the same way we did that.
Please return the book when you've finished reading it.
First things first, let's go to the girl with her head in the clouds.
She took off her sweater.
William ought to apologize.
Hold your tongue, or you'll be punished.
I know that William doesn't know why I need to do that by myself.
I didn't think William was angry.
George and Lucy said that they're really glad they won.
Will you take me with you?
I can't stand this cold anymore.
Please wash it.
I can't make it this time.
Tommy said that he wasn't at home.
Why did you arrive so early?
Let's just be friends.
This sentence is perfect.
I want that job.
No one knew James was an ex-con.
We need a new rug.
George told me that he'd done that.
Don't tell him.
Charlie said he thought that there was a good chance that it would rain tomorrow.
I'll open the box and see what's in it.
Wash your face.
I want you to have this necklace.
I don't know whether to believe her or not.
I heard that Jami is good at doing that.
Is there any chance James wasn't the one who did that?
The Norman victory over England had a big impact on the English language.
She gave him mixed signals.
They said that they're going to do that.
It had worked for hours.
How long have you lived here?
I'll come back for you later.
Let me get you a cup of coffee.
You would've been wrong if you'd said that.
It's going to be easy for us to do that.
You shall not use this form while speaking American English.
If he tries hard, he will succeed.
She promised me she wouldn't do that.
Nothing can be explained.
Charlie is really big.
My elder brother got a position in a big business.
You don't need to prepare a formal speech.
She is second to none when it comes to cooking Chinese food.
Everything happened all at once.
What are your true feelings?
Oscar won't be coming tomorrow.
Jami is a learned man.
What flavor do you want?
Why didn't you tell me you were going to Boston?
Next time I'm at the beach, I'm going to send a message in a bottle.
She was not the first to encourage me to do so.
We tried that yesterday.
What is a god?
I've done a lot.
I don't think William will do that tomorrow.
Oscar never told anyone about what happened that day.
Oliver built a shelter.
However hard he may try, he won't succeed.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Harry is usually as busy as Anna.
They told me that they might do that.
I'd help Muhammad if he wanted me to.
You and I are going to have a lot of fun.
Charlie returned to his room and closed the door.
Tommy is probably just shy.
I thought you had recognized William.
Harry can be seen in the background.
Can you recommend a good hotel?
Joe is going to lose.
William is pretty creative, isn't he?
How long do you intend to be in Australia?
I haven't finished building my house yet.
I think we're lost.
Oliver might be frightened.
Harry and Carmen stayed home from work because they were sick.
Oscar has a plan.
Did William come to Australia with you?
I can't help you until Monday.
I know that Joe doesn't know why Olivia wants John to do that.
Let them keep their jobs.
Anna said she doesn't care whether she wins or not.
That is ordinary-looking.
I think it won't succeed.
I want to cry, but I can't.
Even the fastest horse only has four legs.
You must not be noisy.
All Jacob and Valentina have to do tomorrow is go to school.
I want to participate.
Adam will likely come to visit us next summer.
Open the door. I know you're in there.
My apartment is near here.
I wouldn't miss your wedding for anything.
I don't think we really have to do that.
It was very cold, so we stayed at home.
Think about it one more time.
I thought I would find you there.
I never learned how to swim.
Peter the Cruel is also known as Peter the Just.
Beware of calm waters.
Jami is badly hurt.
They told me they wanted to go.
Joe couldn't fit into the pants he wore last summer.
I think you two know each other.
It's hard to forget what happened.
They said they didn't get it.
There are 40 students in my class.
Jacob finished second-to-last.
Does Harry seriously think anybody will vote for him?
He got up and left in the middle of the discussion.
I'll walk home from here.
Why are you so rich?
Jack insisted on going.
Do you price match?
You may enter.
I don't think it's very likely that William will help us do that.
Harry said that Valentina is shy.
I'll marry her one way or the other.
What makes you think Alex doesn't like you?
I named my dog Cookie.
Why did you think you could do this without any help?
Would I be able to do it?
I thought that Muhammad was dead.
Do you want it gift wrapped?
I saw the car explode.
I really like red.
Jacob said he got really tired of doing that.
And now you have to leave.
He's very open.
Mary paid her bill late.
I feel just like Tommy.
I thought it would be worse.
I'm going to give you just one more chance to do that.
A day is split into the morning, pre-noon, noon, afternoon, evening and night.
I can read French, but I can't speak it.
We'll deal with it later.
Carmen told me that she was safe.
Adam wasn't the only one who was very hungry.
I have to get more sleep.
I laughed so much my stomach hurts.
Jacob has a large mansion.
Alex grew up on a ranch.
Laur began to look for a job three months before she graduated from college.
My arms are empty.
It is no laughing matter.
She only does that when she's angry.
If you continue screaming at me, then we won't talk.
Harry did everything for Catherine.
Joe and Anna say that they need another car.
George became a drug addict.
James asked Carmen if she could give him a ride home.
William tried to contact Valentina.
Isn't Harry incredible?
Muhammad ought to do that somewhere else.
I hope you can all hear me well. That is the point after all.
It's not like it just happened.
You should talk to her.
Did the thought ever cross your mind?
I'm ready to confess.
What is it with you and George?
That's why William and Mary are here.
Jami and Margaret were friends, nothing more.
Tommy found the wallet he thought he'd lost after searching the house from top to bottom.
James might not be as smart as you think he is.
He tried hard, but failed.
I haven't been in Australia very long.
Harry didn't want any pizza.
I told you everything I knew last night.
I haven't had much sleep.
She made clothes for her dolls with her mom.
I decided I should do that.
I like the way you speak.
There are a number of things we can do to protect our environment.
The only car George has ever driven is his own.
I don't think we can trust him.
I wonder where in the world Jami could be right now.
I'm doing this for them.
How would you describe Charlie?
There's no food left.
They loved each other.
If you can't do what you want, do what you can.
I don't think that Alex is allowed to do that.
We met in 2008. A year later, we got married.
If I were you, I wouldn't do such a thing.
I won't have time to finish writing this report before the meeting.
I owe you all nothing!
Mary showed up at the party with her boyfriend.
Did you have to wait long?
Jacob seems comfortable.
Neither Adam nor Emma has a lot of things he needs to buy.
I'm too tired to drive. Could you drive?
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me.
Can you swim across the river?
Jack switched on the desk lamp and started working.
I want to want.
If only the doctor had come a little sooner.
I'm in a little bit of trouble.
By tomorrow morning this girl will have done it.
I don't think George and Laur will do that by themselves.
Everyone had a good year.
It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but I bought it anyway.
Jami became a zombie and then he bit Margaret.
Under the table is a cat.
You should talk to your mother more often.
Charlie was very friendly and helpful.
Laur told me that she wasn't upset.
Do many of you have summer vacation now ?
Oscar hopes he'll get a chance to do that again.
I think you should try to persuade James not to do that.
I tried to avoid talking about that.
Which city do you like better, Boston or Chicago?
Joe felt someone touch his shoulder.
Why don't we see if Jacob wants to go with us?
You should go home. It's late and you're drunk.
Julia is new in town, isn't she?
Could you send me a photo?
I don't think that I need to be here any longer.
Just have a seat.
You're welcome to join us if you want to.
Why are you doing this to me?
I like you as a friend.
Obviously, Jacob doesn't like doing that.
Get ready to be amazed.
Adam is going to be in Boston next week.
What do you think I want?
When you have some free time, please do that.
Eva told me she'd do that if I did that, too.
I'm not afraid of them anymore.
I don't think Adam ever considered doing that.
Can I talk to you alone?
The amateur singer won first in the talent show hands down.
Emma swore she'd never do that to anybody.
She said she needed to take a shower.
I thought Jacob would have remembered today's meeting.
I have a badge.
I don't remember when and where I met you.
I don't think you understand me.
I can get it from her.
Tommy was afraid to cross the street.
I believe you can succeed.
She seemed disappointed and sad.
I told Oliver where he should park his car.
Ah, whatever.
I wonder if Oscar is really broke.
Adam doesn't come to Australia as often as he used to.
How many people survived?
How long have you worked in Australia?
Harry doesn't want you to do that again.
I don't remember you saying anything about Alex coming.
Charlie said that he didn't know who Alice's husband was.
She has a Japanese car.
I knew that was what you wanted.
In Hawaii, one can swim in the ocean all year round.
Oliver and Emma couldn't keep themselves from laughing.
We should wait.
It is a pity that the teacher is leaving our school.
I'm taking a different approach.
Our flight leaves at 2:30.
I think we'll have to help her.
Last night someone broke into the small shop near my house.
She said that she's quit drinking.
If I'd had the time, I would have done that.
Adam was shocked, but Margaret wasn't.
She explained her reasons clearly.
I'll come see you tomorrow.
What do you have in your bag?
Charlie asked Laur to teach John how to drive.
Emma expected Muhammad to kiss her.
It can be that the sentence does not sound natural, though it is correct.
I'm only halfway finished doing that.
I wonder whether we'll really do that.
The teacher said he was going to fail her.
Alex and Susie studied together.
Online dating can be dangerous.
Lucy is getting behind in her work.
I wonder whether or not Jack is having fun.
Tommy won't let me to do that.
I know that Oliver and Eva didn't do that together.
All I did was tell you what Charlie told me.
They were very patient, weren't they?
Jacob isn't part of this.
James didn't say when he would return.
How long did you leave Oscar alone?
He said he was willing to help us.
If he studied hard, he could pass the exam.
Tommy and Eva are a little older than me.
It can't be that big a deal.
Would you like to do something this weekend?
Don't ever compare your wife to another woman.
Don't completely prepare the ground for your children, otherwise they might run their head against a wall.
Joe bought this umbrella in Boston.
Muhammad can't do that alone. I hope Margaret can help him.
We remained silent.
Oliver said stuff about Laur that wasn't true.
We're running out of options.
Apart from the cost, it will take a long time to build the bridge.
Tommy thought Catherine was sleeping, but she was actually awake.
Alex told me Laur died on Monday.
He could not leave the thing alone.
Oliver and Anna claim they can do that.
How long do you expect Muhammad to stay here?
You said you'd help them.
I know that Jack knows that Olivia knows that she doesn't need to do that.
Where will you stay?
Charlie learned he shouldn't do that from his parents.
You're not invited to lunch.
He appears brave, but it's just an act.
Muhammad and Susie don't think I did that, do they?
Do you have a solution?
This poem was written by him last night.
You took your sweet time.
Stay close.
Something can be both the beginning and the end.
Don't forget to do your homework, OK?
Is there anything I can do to help out?
I think that you're going to like Australia.
They want to change the law.
He put this box on the table-top.
I was tired and hungry, and so was everyone else.
Don't talk about it.
She seemed to want me to help her.
What's the ambassador's name?
They planned on going by themselves.
I know that you're talented.
I know Muhammad is a very old friend of yours.
Can I just use this quickly please?
Do you still think you'll get into Harvard?
William was just trying to protect himself.
Whoever says so is a liar.
Can we talk about something else please?
Harry was convinced that Carmen didn't want to do that.
She said it didn't bother her.
They look like they've been crying.
I'll let everybody know.
William and Lucy told me they wouldn't win.
Harry told me that he was planning to go to Australia.
What is it that you want from me?
Oscar probably went out.
I'm going to need more money than that.
Instead of taking the elevator, let's take the stairs.
Charlie said that no one was arrested.
You said it was an emergency, so I came right away.
Oliver isn't talking to me.
Emma is getting fat, isn't she?
I know that Charlie didn't do that, even though he said he did.
Olivia is a good kid, isn't she?
Tommy and Mary didn't tell John what they needed to buy.
Joe should've been able to do that in three hours.
I hope that Harry hasn't been seriously hurt.
Is she any better today?
Tell James I'm doing my homework.
It took three weeks for me to get over my cold.
He cut himself with a razor.
A lot of our mistakes come from a lack of patience.
I realize I don't have enough time to do what needs to be done.
We're not desperate yet.
It'll probably snow tomorrow.
I don't do that very much.
I think you're doing well.
The parents are criminals!
I don't think James is sure that that's what Valentina wants to do.
You have a passing grade.
You found Oscar, didn't you?
I checked twice to make certain we hadn't made any mistakes.
Jacob didn't see the truck coming.
What do you do there?
Oscar didn't want to live any longer.
James is almost always at home on October 20th.
Tommy brought a salad.
The suicide letter reads: "To my family, I am finally free. Love, Julia."
Tommy has young children.
Oliver has had many unhappy experiences.
What is my room number?
I've always hated you.
It looks like Muhammad is exhausted.
Harry hopes to do that this weekend.
You warned Jacob not to do that, didn't you?
He held out his hand to welcome us.
I met her in Boston last week.
Let go of my son.
The number of fish caught in this river was very small.
We call on her now and again.
I know Harry has to do that again.
I know how you feel about this.
I believe more in diet than in drugs.
This one works.
I heard that you'll do that.
They're young.
Do you think George and Olivia want to live in Boston?
Jack said that he wanted to be left alone.
You can join us if you want.
She kissed her kids goodbye.
And here they are.
Oscar must have been nervous.
Do you have what we need?
It must've been very difficult for you to do that.
All you have to do is open your mouth and eat.
We're willing to do anything we can to help.
Joe said Monica only does that in the morning.
Emma denied that she agreed to do that.
Can't you be a little more patient?
Now why would you go and do a stupid thing like that?
Charlie isn't a drug addict.
I don't know whether I should laugh or cry.
Snakes are scary.
Alex planned to kill Alice.
If you're not in a hurry, please stay a little longer.
Don't you want Joe to be happy?
It's deeply embarrassing.
George said he knew that Margaret might do that on October 20th.
Harry told me he was different from all the other guys.
Would you like to hold my hand?
Is Harry badly hurt?
It's the first time that this has happened to me.
I can't promise anything, but I'll do my best.
You didn't drink that water, did you?
We could fix that.
He told me that he'd do that again.
Oliver injured himself.
I'm not sure what Jack does for a living.
You wrote this three years ago.
We practice a lot.
How much should you exercise?
Why were only students invited?
Joe told me that he thought Carmen would be at tomorrow's meeting.
Since he was honest, I hired him.
Let's go to eat together.
Jacob said that he plans on doing that Monday.
Harry and Julia sold their house.
Alice didn't tell me why she was going to Boston.
She said she felt very tired.
Who do you think that man is?
It still needs to be answered.
Do Charlie and Carmen attend mass?
Don't look directly at her.
I was promoted three months ago.
I'm looking for my boots.
Interest in the game has dropped off.
This child is slim.
Can you hear anything?
Can Tommy come, too?
So, what's your secret?
I feel much better now.
I work among friends, and I live among books.
What can't you do?
Jacob has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Why are you so bent out of shape?
Hurry up, and you will be in time for school.
Who's going to help you do that?
Charlie and Olivia didn't tell John what they wanted to eat.
Doing that will be more fun than you think.
Those are our orders.
I just transferred from Australia.
I'm not supposed to leave here.
I'm pretty sure James hasn't done anything he didn't need to do.
You're such a genius.
It might tell us something.
James grabbed Valentina by the collar.
What can you teach me?
Oliver is a chemistry professor.
What was it like when Harry kissed you?
We should make it if the traffic isn't too heavy.
James picked up that habit from his father.
Alex isn't likely to do that today.
They all got behind the candidate.
I have a spare today.
Yesterday was my grandmother's birthday.
Could you please stop doing that?
Do you want to eat this?
She's very strict as a teacher.
I knew Oscar would show Eva how to do that if she asked him to.
Never mind!
I expect Charlie to take care of himself.
When should I pick you up tomorrow?
Joe may be there.
Never call me again!
It isn't nice to keep a lady waiting.
"Where does Alex get his ability in French? He's never set foot in a French-speaking country, and he has no French-speaking friends, either." "I believe he watches a lot of French movies on the Internet."
We must keep Oscar from doing that.
I wish I had the answer.
Why is Muhammad planning to do that?
I tried to call you yesterday evening. Were you out?
Adam says he's used to this kind of work.
I hope Joe doesn't need to do that.
Eva begged me to let her in.
I don't think that we can see each other anymore.
You know as well as I do that Adam doesn't know how to swim.
I wouldn't refuse to do that if I were you.
I want to be an astronaut.
Oliver doesn't seem to be as miserable as Lucy seems to be.
My mother is very busy right now.
Adam knows where Alice is going.
I would never allow that.
I'm pretty certain that Jami is in Boston now.
This directly concerns you.
I tried to tell you that three years ago.
Which is more common?
At what day are you off, usually?
Julia said she plans on staying until Monday.
Does it make any difference?
I've met a lot of bad guys.
What a loss!
Alex really doesn't have a choice.
Does Jacob have a bicycle?
Money isn't everything.
Why did the FBI raid Adam's house?
Did William say why he's going to Australia?
You could at least tell Olivia that she doesn't have to do that anymore.
The surgery was yesterday.
Harry doesn't want to do that by himself.
I just wasn't expecting this to happen.
Harry isn't likely to be on time.
I don't think that you really need to do that.
Did you drink a lot?
How long do you think it'll take us to do this?
Valentina said she knew she might be allowed to do that.
She wore a loose jacket.
We don't get many chances to do that.
Where are you today?
Muhammad said that Susie was troubled by what happened.
Leave everything as you found it.
I also have a house in Australia.
I hope that Muhammad and Eva get along.
Who is the gentleman he is speaking to?
She looks better today than when I her saw last.
I am no longer young, but I can still bite.
Is your house near a lake?
You look like you're anxious.
I can't be friends with Harry.
William said he wasn't sure Alice wanted to do that.
You mean it, don't you?
She's a night owl.
Would you mind if I tag along with you next time you go for a walk?
Joe should've gone to Australia last summer.
Alex told Emma not to be afraid to do that.
Do you speak Greek? - Not yet, that's my first lesson!
Eva looked like she was worried.
We can't stand apart. We ought to do something.
William said that he was willing to pay up to $300.
Who did Jami and Olivia say they were looking for?
Alex told me he thought Carmen was adopted.
I'll be home right after work.
I wanted to know where the voice was coming from.
Oliver headed back to Boston.
How do I get back?
I don't want to cause anyone any more trouble.
There's a rumor that Tommy is gay.
This is where it happened.
I asked them the same thing.
James said that he was glad to see you.
When are you going to get back from Australia?
The communication of news by TV and radio is very common now.
We were delayed in Boston.
He saved my life at the risk of his own.
Dan seemed a promising suspect.
Tommy didn't really like the concert.
Susie said that she wasn't very sorry for what she'd done.
I think it'll rain soon.
What if William and Catherine say no?
I didn't know George used to teach you French.
I bought a lot of things.
Muhammad stuck his pencil behind his ear.
I must have lost my key along the way.
Alex almost always helps Carmen with her homework.
The man who's sitting next to Oliver is his father.
Are there any good films on this week?
She was holding an umbrella.
When will you be coming back from Boston?
I wonder if we'll still be able do that.
Tommy often changes jobs.
What belongs to you is in danger when your neighbour's house is on fire.
You're on your own for lunch.
That's hard to believe.
Should we help Jack pay for that?
I'll do that if you pay me.
I have a pain in my chest.
I already read all the Harry Potter books.
Come along with me.
Alex and Margaret are hoping you can do that with them.
Emma's husband must be missing her.
Your research will surely bear fruit.
Are these the friends you told me about?
I had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to-night I'd go down the track to that big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night.
Drink some coffee. It tastes very good, I think.
There is heavy traffic in this street.
Adam arrived very early this morning.
Oliver took his ball and went home.
Get out! I don't want to talk to you!
Tommy and Emma told me that they weren't afraid.
I still haven't told Jami why I don't have to do that.
We'll wait until it's dark.
James is likely to still be in Boston now.
Jami said that he didn't want to argue.
The problem is that they only think about themselves.
Do you usually take an afternoon nap?
We could have managed without William's help.
The member of the family who is always in trouble is the black sheep.
I would have done that if I'd known how.
His theory is difficult to understand.
You've got nothing to be afraid of.
You're a bad coach.
My resume isn't as impressive as yours.
Do we have any more beer?
What is your choice?
Muhammad didn't use a cake mix. He made it from scratch.
I know William doesn't know I want to do that.
Muhammad should be in Boston by this time tomorrow.
Adam put on his glasses and began to read.
I assume Jacob will be here today.
I hope Muhammad knows why he doesn't need to do that.
James says it's up to you to do that.
I've got to go and get her.
James said he couldn't wait much longer.
Once you did it, never do it again.
I wonder if Adam and Lucy are worried.
The boss gave me permission to go home early.
I thought that Jami wasn't doing that anymore.
I think Tommy has three options.
My father's saying nothing.
Why didn't he go to Germany?
You didn't know that I had to do that, did you?
I don't have time right now to talk to anyone.
She tried to protect herself.
I don't like Boston as much as I used to.
Does Adam like your new haircut?
I would like if this didn't happen.
Don't talk about that in front of him.
Adam noticed Laur the moment she entered the room.
Money isn't the problem.
Jami showed his room to me.
Her hair hid her face.
I can bring you some water, if you like.
We don't even know what time we're supposed to be there yet.
What William said didn't make much sense.
I thought that Harry wasn't seeing anyone.
I'm working in a town not too far from Boston.
She has done what she had to do.
Two thousand people fit into this hall.
Tommy said he thought Monica was surprised.
Oscar heard the noise.
He was making his way through the crowd.
Susie is very proud of herself.
I didn't know that Jacob needed to do that again.
What time is the show?
They swore they wouldn't do that today.
Pleased to meet you, George.
You'll have to do that on your own.
I don't really have to do that anymore.
I'm pretty sure that I won't be arrested.
I don't think that anything's going to change.
Lucy said she doesn't mind doing that.
Harry and Monica have made a very big mistake.
I think that Jack is self-centered.
Jacob doesn't think Anna would likely do that.
I don't want to be the manager.
Are you in immediate danger?
You would've done the same.
I've been waiting a long time.
Laur said she thought Alex was suspicious.
My advice wasn't followed.
He cut down a tree in his yard.
I tend to look at the pictures before reading the text.
Where does this piece go?
I want to thank all of you for coming here today.
Oliver painted Susie with angel wings.
We are going to have a storm.
He asked his friends for help.
As you can see, the roof needs to be replaced.
Do you think you're bigger than Harry?
He devoted himself to the study of English literature.
Jami told everybody he was cold.
He hardly ever talks about himself.
I did it already.
Would you like to sit down?
The pond dried up last summer.
You didn't know that I had to help Joe do that, did you?
What you don't know can't hurt you.
I never asked your advice.
Have you talked to your sister recently?
Those are questions that I can't answer.
It's nice, living in the countryside.
Children should obey their parents.
What a big cake!
That's why we need to protest.
Lucy can't seem to control her anger.
Could you send me a photo of you?
Adam is traveling with his parents.
Alex won the contest.
That needs to be corrected.
This is such a surprise.
Did you know George lived in Australia for three years?
We know that Jami is unlikely to do that unless we help him.
She knew it from the start.
I didn't know that Harry and Eva were good at doing that.
Would you accept those terms?
Could you close the door, please?
He wants us to help him.
That's hard to picture.
You should let Joe buy that for you.
I wasn't as angry as everybody thought I was.
We can't afford to waste any more time.
Tommy won't likely be back soon.
He might still change his mind.
I don't like to eat the same kinds of food that Charlie likes to eat.
Harry went into Anna's office.
Can you tell me about them?
Does it upset you?
It has always been a pleasure to work with you.
People who play with mud will get their hands dirty.
Don't try to be a hero now.
I had no idea that Jami and Carmen were lying to us.
I want this letter registered.
I would like to thank you in advance for any help that you are able to give her.
You should study French harder.
Do you think you can help Oliver with that?
Alice told me that she had to split.
All hope is gone.
Did you forget your money?
He is more human in thinking than his father.
George said that he was enjoying himself.
I hope Jami isn't sleepy.
I didn't feel wanted.
Keep arms above head at all times or you will be shot on sight.
I'm a nervous wreck.
Joe and Susie watched TV until they fell asleep.
This is really good practice for you, isn't it?
I heard Muhammad went to Boston.
Please sit according to your number.
She asked me to pick her up at the station.
I was in bed all day long yesterday.
George knew nothing about the murders.
Watch James.
Not again!
We'll come to look for you.
You're still too young to get a driver's license.
Is your father a doctor?
He ate rice twice a day for many years.
You need to stop doing that right now.
Harry almost killed himself trying to do that.
They have no children, for all I know.
I don't know what size shoes George wears.
Tommy made a few serious mistakes.
We've got to discuss business.
Oscar said that Susie wasn't angry.
You've got nice legs.
Julia is slow, isn't she?
I wish I could actually do that.
Jack brought up the subject.
It isn't an issue.
We don't have any cream.
I intend to buy my wife a gold bracelet.
I was the only one who didn't fall into the trap.
How long will you remain in New York?
I am a fan of cars.
Would you mind saying that once more?
I'm afraid we're out of stock.
Are you falling for me?
I'm still training her.
Mary realized she was trapped.
This is a table.
I don't think Oscar will be using this.
Alex doesn't have to do that, does he?
He loves studying music.
Oliver said he thought he wouldn't enjoy doing that.
Harry could be stubborn at times.
Tommy looked concerned.
There's a good chance that Charlie will be punished for doing that.
Oscar used to be a professional baseball player.
Jack would have to be pretty stupid to do that.
In this life anything could happen.
Why did you write this book?
Let's go to Boston first.
That's not how it works. Let me show you how.
I was always different.
Harry said that he saw Eva this morning.
What is his character like?
The gentleman best knows himself the value of his own life.
Deep down Harry is a good guy.
Jacob said that Anna was willing to help us.
Wait here. I'll return shortly.
Surely, there is some way we can fix this.
They really don't like the rules.
You aren't the police, are you?
I met her an hour ago.
Both Jack and Emma know what happened.
He's either crazy or on drugs.
He doesn't like any sport.
My family have lived here for twenty years.
She sings.
I don't see why you should do that.
I'm a lot younger than Jack.
Can you watch Jami and Valentina?
Jacob doesn't have enough money to buy what he needs.
Did you go to Tokyo Tower?
Even if it's not true, it's a brilliant invention.
I wonder why Susie lied to us about where she'd been.
I couldn't get them to wake up.
The woman precisely knows that she doesn't know what she wants.
Do we have enough gas for the trip?
I'd like to drink something hot.
She kissed him to the point that she couldn't stop.
Charlie and Emma are devoted to each other.
He was almost drowned.
Oliver isn't going to make it on time.
We should probably help them.
Please say hello to your wife for me.
Oliver wasn't aware Lucy was in the hospital.
Muhammad seems to believe everything Eva says.
We have to fix the date for our trip quickly.
Do you think you're strong?
I thought that I ought to do something differently.
His behavior truly surprised me.
Is Jacob OK?
I know that Jack is a better cook than Anna.
He works hard. So he does.
Oliver is just like everyone else.
Don't speak to him like that.
Anna is being stubborn, isn't she?
I didn't wake up well this morning.
I said the exact same thing to George.
There's a pile of letters on my desk that I have to answer.
I'm afraid I can't do that for you.
It has: it is in the heart of the Chinese people.
You're going to break it if you're not careful.
We should be going now.
I don't know much about fishing.
They looked away from her.
I'm afraid that he might be late for the train.
I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
The terms and conditions are subject to change at any time.
What are some good German movies?
He makes it a rule to write in his diary every day.
I still do that once in a while.
It's all going to work out, you'll see.
Please tell me it's crazy.
Leave them as they are or not at all.
"Well good, give me those four." "I will give you half – if you wish." "Why not all of them?" "Because I need two myself."
The service agent helped me solve my problem.
Excuse me, how much is this?
Charlie says he's learned a lot in the last three years.
Jacob and Olivia aren't going to make it in time.
Jacob and Laur are likely never to see each other again.
The price is kind of high, but it's worth it.
I don't know if Jami wants to do that or not.
You must've done something.
Margaret says she found it on the bench.
I thought Harry was meeting us here.
You're incredibly hot.
Do you have to do this every time?
She thought that she had to do that.
I don't think Oscar ought to do that here.
Make sure you don't hurt yourself.
She talks well.
Oliver suggested to Carmen that she stay away from John.
Don't ignore the signs you asked God to show you.
I miss you badly.
I work nights.
I won't stand here all day.
Joe should have learned French when he had the chance.
Oscar and Julia say they don't remember asking John to do that.
I'll help my mother wash the dishes after supper.
Emma says she isn't busy.
Lucy is afraid of the dark, isn't she?
Jacob is waiting for his son to come back home.
Adam wants to learn how to drive a car.
What must he have?
They wiped away their tears.
I took over the business from Father.
It is at best a second-rate hotel.
I know James knows who did that.
I thought that you wanted to play.
I did everything that Joe suggested.
Lunch would be great.
James isn't anything like his brother.
I know Jack is a good singer.
I'm following you.
There's no doubt Muhammad was murdered.
I really did have a great time.
That is disgusting!
I haven't heard anything.
James isn't the right man for you.
Harry didn't want to answer those questions.
There is no end to our troubles.
Eva is happy, isn't she?
If I see Muhammad and Margaret, I'll tell them that you're looking for them.
What a good idea!
You don't sleep much, do you?
Mary is my older brother's wife.
I would never have done such a thing.
I've never won anything in my life.
Alex wishes he had gone to the theater last night.
William has a daughter who's pretty tall.
He has just arrived.
She got more than she expected.
Jacob says that he doesn't know much about Australia.
Why didn't I think of this?
I didn't know Oscar would really want to do that.
I know William is a university student.
I expect him to help me.
Life is strange sometimes.
Did anybody get injured?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
I didn't see a ghost.
He walked in the park yesterday.
I felt a sudden pain in my side.
A report came in that Apollo 11 succeeded in landing on the moon.
It was hard for Adam to keep a straight face.
Until next year!
The rain stopped us from being able to play tennis outside.
I know Jacob is a pretty close friend of yours.
When was the last time you sent a letter abroad?
You made it, Oliver!
I lost my inspiration.
William stepped out of the car.
There is a table in the corner of the room.
I wonder why Adam and Margaret didn't do what we asked them to do.
Oliver doesn't know I'm here.
He was perfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out the sweat on me like running.
William seemed scared about something.
I know Harry doesn't know Emma won't be able to do that.
George got off with a warning.
I tend to agree with him.
I don't know what's wrong with Jami.
I wish you didn't have to go.
I stayed with my uncle last week.
This time, you won't escape punishment.
I didn't tell Oscar to stop.
When does George usually eat?
Can you still ride a bicycle?
Harry said that he has to do that by himself.
I think Emma said that she'd do that.
Are you making Jacob a sandwich?
We went aboard the plane.
She'll be late if she doesn't hurry.
Alex is a former truck driver.
"Can I show you something?" "Sure."
It's important I hear this.
I don't think that Oliver did that on purpose.
She sticks out like a sore thumb.
It isn't something I can miss.
Harry told me he thought you could win.
He asked me to communicate his wishes to you.
Charlie played tennis.
How much weight have you lost?
I'm pretty sure that James doesn't do that anymore.
Jacob usually makes two or three cups of tea with one tea bag.
Muhammad couldn't have known what had happened.
Do you really want to know why I didn't do what you asked me to do?
I don't want to discuss that with Muhammad.
Muhammad stopped the fight.
Jami said that he hadn't intended to hurt Julia.
Jack and Susie have spent all their money.
Those are true statements.
Tommy is scary, isn't he?
I understand that no one wants to help us.
Oscar knows that he should do that soon.
Why were you driving Jami's car?
Adam called Anna, but somebody else answered her phone.
It looks like you've been crying.
What's so pressing?
We've got them over a barrel.
Though only 16, he is independent of his parents.
I wonder why Adam is so lazy.
She may not like what she sees.
I don't know about this one.
Olivia thought that she'd be safe there.
It's amazing how much he can stand.
Your shirts need to be washed.
The way Adam drives, he's going to have an accident sooner or later.
Carmen's father doesn't allow her to drive.
You won't get rid of me that easily.
Alice said she didn't have the courage to do that.
Is the school work hard?
Never have I seen such a cute puppy as this.
Adam and Lucy told me that they were bored.
George felt a little nervous.
Can you take a look at this for me?
Ask him whether George is at home or not.
The food is getting cold.
I admit that I didn't do what I was supposed to do.
His letter made me angry.
John passed among the crowd.
I like pepper.
I will try.
Harry was really excited about that.
I thought that there was a good chance that Oliver wouldn't want to go with us.
It's a small problem.
Laur was hurt.
William said I looked sophisticated.
Jami really knows a lot about baseball.
Adam did everything he could to keep Anna from doing that.
William will spend tomorrow here.
My brother isn't home.
It seemed that Tommy and Monica were sick.
Eva says she didn't know she had to do that.
All hope abandon, ye who enter in.
Which factory was it?
Oliver is a very talented young director.
What kind of songs are popular these days?
I don't think Oscar wanted us to do that.
In the end, Jane didn't buy it.
I know that Harry is a friend of Julia's.
I'll be staying for a while.
You're really bad at it.
A couple of months ago, they laid me off.
He surprised me.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
Tommy got a bottle of water out of the fridge.
He doesn't talk to his neighbors.
I don't see the problem here.
I know why Oscar got fat.
Laur is really creative, isn't she?
We still don't know.
I hated her.
My mother cannot drive a car at all.
Jacob and Anna said they weren't the least bit tired.
I know that George is a very patient man.
They have no children, to the best of my knowledge.
Alex is more likely to help than Mary is.
When's your first class?
I know Jami is out on the porch.
This rule allows no exception.
That's what I was trying to tell you.
I doubt that Adam will want to do that on October 20th.
My mother can't read without glasses.
I'm going to Boston on business.
I'm supposed to make sure William doesn't forget to buy the tickets.
Muhammad wasn't prepared to do that.
I need to tell her something.
I'll come by.
Something wonderful happened last Monday.
If you've got a problem, I'd like to know what it is.
Jami said that he thought that Catherine would enjoy doing that.
She talks about everything with her parents.
The only thing George ate was one slice of bread.
As for me, I will not approve of the plan.
Maybe some other time.
I don't have to say anything to Muhammad.
This is way too difficult for me.
James needed space.
I don't really know what was going on.
How are you dealing with all the stress?
I didn't expect Muhammad to be so friendly.
Do you eat a lot of fish?
I tear my clothes when I work in the garden.
Jack comes to Australia every other Christmas.
How did you find out that Muhammad didn't do that?
Don't talk back to me! I know what's better for you.
Now let's move on.
I've never sung in public before.
James may want to stay in Australia until the end of the month.
I'm trying to get back in shape.
The teacher's young daughter was a beautiful blonde with big blue eyes.
This new technology cannot fail, can it?
Your parents raised you well.
I am always harder on myself than I am on other people.
Could you stop, please?
William noticed something was odd.
The trouble is that it costs too much.
That bridge isn't long.
"Jump across the ditch." "I will if you will."
She cut her finger on the broken glass.
Who'll do that for us?
Written too quickly, the letter had many mistakes.
They all have arms, legs, and heads, they walk and talk, but now there's SOMETHING that wants to make them different.
I used to do that when I was a kid.
He said each meeting should begin with a prayer.
What shall I experience?
I need some answers from him.
He lifted the spoon up to his mouth.
This hotel belongs to my brother-in-law.
Who did you translate this for?
Why don't you just go talk to her?
They lied to us.
This is Adam's.
They all stopped.
Let me give you a little money.
Harry has long blond hair and blue eyes.
Tommy grew up in foster care.
Is there any chance Oscar will agree to the plan?
The dog is in the house.
I know that Jami and Monica are embarrassed.
Oscar moved to Australia a year ago Monday.
Do you think that what we did helped?
Read me your speech.
Muhammad said he was frightened.
Mike, how's it going?
Only James can talk to Emma.
He can handle English well.
James and Susie say they didn't know John wouldn't want to do that.
Oliver said he hoped that Monica wouldn't cry.
James promised Emma that he'd help her get ready for the party.
William asked us what we would do if the weather was nice.
George always wondered why Susie hated John.
Alex looked around the room, but didn't see Lucy.
Is it true that you dated William in high school?
Do you like this music?
Harry is likely to do that.
Let's try to do something.
Aren't you a little too young to be dating a guy as old as Oliver?
I thought he would be upset.
We need to do that immediately.
I might not leave Boston.
Emily is staying in Melanie's house.
I nearly forgot to give it to Jami.
George is the right boy for the job.
Harry looked closer.
We should have done what Jami wanted us to do.
Send Joe over.
I can't sleep with all this noise.
Many foreigners speak good Japanese.
George said that he hopes that Carmen will be at the party.
Alex wasn't up yet.
You're going to love it.
My mom is two years younger than my dad.
Mary was taken hostage.
He's by himself.
I hope Oliver and Emma aren't drunk.
Please don't mention this to anyone.
He is not like he seems.
Harry is going to be waiting for us in the lobby.
Did you think that I was making too much noise?
You can tell me anything you like and I won't tell anyone else.
It looks like it might rain, so don't forget your umbrella.
It would be dangerous to do that now.
Charlie and Carmen said they thought John might want to do that.
They have talent.
She had a radio.
She has asked the person at the front desk to connect her to that number.
What do you mean by this expression?
I'm taking my coffee with me.
That will be enough for now.
I think Charlie was lying to us.
Don't hold back, shout.
You don't like Alex, do you?
Can you show us the house?
I know one thing, that I know nothing.
Just tell me what you need.
What can I do to convince you?
He didn't pay anything.
Olivia is always prepared, isn't she?
We need your expert opinion.
I need to go to the gym.
I take it you know him.
How much is left in your savings account?
This food doesn't taste good at all.
I hope you don't say something stupid.
Did you plan that with her?
He acts like he knows everything.
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?
I sent the package to William and Emma yesterday, so they should get it by Monday.
James tried to impress the young lady.
Alex probably won't be able to do that as well as Monica.
When does Anna want me to help her do that?
Do you know why Muhammad is late?
You may want to tell him that.
They are going to throw a party for Sam.
I need a pair of scissors.
We could meet for a drink.
I thought I was a train.
It is not really visible to the naked eye.
I just realized those are much more pages that I have thought.
Does Oliver go to the market?
Your purse is open.
I was just fooling around.
He had no chance to defend himself.
You should think before you begin to speak.
You're being negative again.
She answered her own question.
I should have seen that coming.
Slow your horses!
Oscar said he'd be driving to Boston on Monday.
She said she hasn't yet done that.
I wanted to do that yesterday, but I couldn't.
James is lucky Susie is here to help him do that.
Tommy was wearing gloves.
Does Oscar go to school?
I think that package is for Tommy.
Harry said that he knew Lucy was going to be late.
I don't know why we say it like that, we just do.
I can't do that to you.
All is in the hands of man. Therefore wash them often.
Jami and Eva said they knew they might not be allowed to do that.
Many students go to Europe for the purpose of studying music.
I had no other choice but to take him at his word.
Harry knows that I'm not very happy about it.
We were just in time for the last train.
They locked her up.
William has a very good voice.
Jack said he was almost ready to do that.
I think it's time to eat.
What do you think about the future?
Oscar will give Catherine everything she wants.
Why can't they do it?
Adam seemed a bit crazy.
I perform my work very well.
Why is Oscar being nice to me?
He deserved it.
Maybe you should do this together.
Muhammad isn't confused, but Alice is.
I think that Oliver doesn't want to go to the dance with Margaret.
How fast can you walk over here?
Oscar threw a cup of cold water on Anna's face to wake her up.
I'll take it up with them.
With any luck, there will be no school tomorrow.
George had an affair.
Have I any letters or messages?
I didn't know how much James wanted to do that.
Adam seemed naive.
I'm sure Jami could teach Anna how to do that.
You'll stay in my hotel.
I hope you get that job in Australia that you want.
I'm sorry for my late response.
I'm likely to go to Boston in the fall.
This was your idea, wasn't it?
He knows why.
Why does Jacob want to go to Australia?
The child next door has to attend three different extra classes every month.
Lucy said she's never eaten Thai food.
James said Lucy was grateful for what you did for her.
That's fine.
William said that he knew Eva might not want to do that.
A good many people have an interest in things American.
Tommy hit one of the boys and knocked him to the ground.
I imagine he's not going to be too happy about that.
I don't cut her hair.
Oliver is much better than I am at doing that.
Jacob and Susie pretended to be angry even though they really weren't.
The problem was beyond me.
Charlie was one of us.
Nothing could have prepared Oscar for what was about to happen.
Can I come tomorrow, too?
Would you like some wine?
He's serious.
Adam said you're stubborn.
I hope someone will do that for Jacob.
Harry says he needs to go home right away.
I need to learn how to do that.
The weather couldn't have been better.
I was surprised when Charlie said he was unhappy here.
Jack thinks his job is pointless.
The library is closing.
I know that Harry hasn't asked Anna to do that yet.
You were just doing your duty.
Carmen picked some fresh flowers from the garden.
Jack and Anna are going to pay me back what they owe me on Monday.
James won't likely be pleased.
Adam didn't come today, either.
Can you help me with this?
I'm supposed to make sure there's no trouble.
We shouldn't fight.
Charlie can't understand why Monica is angry.
Jacob told Susie he needed to talk to her.
Harry probably doesn't know that Julia needs to do that.
You'll get another chance to do that later.
Did you ask Jack and Emma if they did that by themselves?
I'd rather die than surrender.
Do you think I had something to do with that?
How far away is your farm?
Jacob looks like he's lost weight.
I don't know where Jami and Laur were going.
George and Alice wished they'd been more careful.
This was easier than I thought it would be.
William asked Monica to buy him something to drink.
I doubt very seriously that Adam will be tomorrow afternoon.
I didn't know that Alex was living on Park Street.
Charlie is better off now than he was three years ago.
She canceled her appointment.
My sister is not very organized and forgot to register for the course.
I've always thought you were from Australia.
Waiter, bring me a double.
Harry wants to get a dog.
Joe put down his spoon and picked up his cup.
I don't eat dark meat.
Let me be your alibi.
Look after her.
Carol often watches horror films.
She made fun of her husband.
George never laid a hand on me.
In summer, it is hot.
I'm not going to talk about that.
Have you found them yet?
Please tell Harry that I'll do that tomorrow.
Oscar bought Laur something.
Dan wanted to live in Mexico.
Would you like to talk about what Charlie did?
Adam pretended that he didn't know that Olivia had stolen his money.
She couldn't resist.
She's hoping we'll do that with her.
I didn't have any reason not to trust Joe.
Joe has already decided that he isn't going to stay here.
Don't sit on the counter.
Now you can cross the road.
Please follow the school rules.
You ought to have come to my wedding reception earlier.
Jacob and I didn't like each other.
I got out of the pool.
I suppose I could buy that for you.
Both Adam and Anna should have known better.
A dance will be held on Friday.
Charlie told me that he thought that Mary knew French.
Valentina is getting married, isn't she?
Instead of laying off these workers, why don't we just cut their hours?
This is the first time that we've given a concert in Boston.
The university is a waste of time.
James knew that I was going to win.
A fly is as likely to land on shit as it will on pie.
I thought Alex and Carmen were lying.
Oscar could do that now if you wanted him to.
Oscar never got a chance to talk to Valentina.
Jacob might not need to do that.
That guy is very self-centered.
Who cares what they think?
Oscar is on fire.
Tommy knew where he'd put his keys.
He's in love with words.
He was at the front for three months.
I'm not saying it's not possible.
I thought I smelled bacon.
Jami and Eva said that they weren't sorry.
Does she have a piano?
They know exactly what they should do.
He likes Catherine.
A lot of companies are going under lately because banks are so tight with their money.
I'm just being me.
We have many friends.
George would want us to continue.
Jack said that Monica wanted to borrow some money from him.
Eva says that Jack has a new girlfriend.
I haven't told you the most important thing yet.
I don't know if George is coming or not.
We must leave!
Oliver claims he's never done that.
Do you smell something strange?
I don't want to live like that.
Charlie doesn't know whether Julia likes him or not.
Jami said that he didn't know Catherine was going to eventually do that.
I drove the car.
Can you excuse me for a minute?
I go to Boston quite often.
Why should James and Julia insist that John do that for them?
You should have already discussed that with James.
Jacob doesn't like the way Julia treats John.
Oliver doesn't seem to be as happy as Mary.
She phoned him several times but he was too busy to return her call.
I'm sure George and Susie don't hate you.
I'll do everything that I can.
You aren't allergic to anything, are you?
I understand a little French, but I can't speak it very well.
The children are playing outside.
Look, you can't wing the test and expect to ace it, Joe.
I've sent it by Post.
I like your shoes.
Let's get off the subject.
I don't think I heard you correctly.
Are you going in costume this year?
I'm almost certain that won't happen today.
She looks like she's tired.
You'd better take care of it.
Lucy says she'll still be here at 2:30.
I am sure of your son coming back safe and sound.
How long has that been happening?
I have plans to go to Boston next month.
Forgive me, but I have no change.
Joe is incredibly stupid, isn't he?
You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket.
Muhammad never quit anything.
Tommy said that it was quite easy to do that.
The city is at the foot of the mountain.
Tell Charlie and Laur that they should lose some weight.
I know that she doesn't know who I am.
I don't think I'll go today.
You don't need to go unless you want to.
Do you still think that's what Oliver wants?
I seem to have run out of steam this term.
You borrow a book.
This is the book Oliver was talking about yesterday.
I knew that George knew who did that for him.
Tommy isn't boring, but Julia is.
Jami went to the window to get a better look at what was happening.
George couldn't convince Mary that he was innocent.
Muhammad slept much longer than he had planned to.
It's an opportunity to get to know each other better.
The fish was delicious.
What makes you think I won't sing?
George didn't know that I couldn't do that.
Alice said that she was eating.
She was wearing a strange hat.
William just called me a few minutes ago.
I hope that you know that the last thing I want to do is hurt you.
Oliver probably doesn't study French.
Jami said that it was him who should show Olivia how to do that.
Are you the boss?
That's why I like Jami.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
I'm going to do that this fall.
Anna said she thinks Alex can take care of himself.
Did you get anything?
The deadline is drawing near.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
How can I get in touch with you?
It looks like Adam and Eva have done that.
It's the height of madness to say so.
Come home right away.
What kind of bait do you think would be the best to use?
This is probably the last thing I will ever post.
I just want people to be careful.
The island is very easy to reach.
James and I both saw Catherine slap John.
I was late because I was sure that the lessons started later.
How did she get involved?
It's a beautiful picture.
Alex hasn't done anything all morning.
I found Oscar.
I will stay at home.
Did you know that's from Australia?
Olivia called to tell Jack that she'd be late.
Jacob and Margaret told John they wouldn't do that again.
Jack broke up with Susie and has started going out Alice.
After a long day at work, nothing is better than a good night's sleep.
Do you have any cash?
I'm probably not the only person who wants to do that.
I had trouble getting the window open.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Harry is fighting in the street.
There must be some kind of misunderstanding.
Just as I thought.
You've got a bright future.
I realize that Harry hasn't been doing that.
Careful! Someone could hear us!
I saw you with Valentina.
I don't like it when Jacob and Julia stay out late at night.
Laur said she hoped she could learn how to do that.
He is being very polite today.
Will you do what you're told, for once?
I don't know where we'll go tomorrow.
I thought that we played well.
Get me a slice of pie, too.
When his wife died, he received dozens of letters of sympathy.
I love reading science fiction.
Don't let her throw her life away.
Valentina told me that she's broke.
Those who lose themselves in passion lose less than those who lose their passion.
They intended to kill themselves.
I don't go fishing very much anymore, but I used to go quite often.
She said that she'd win and she did.
I hope we'll be able to do that.
I wondered if Charlie was going to do that by himself.
I know you're angry with me.
I live next to Oliver.
It was lucky you were there to help Jami.
Is your French getting better?
George said Emma often leaves early.
He isn't as weak as he used to be.
Can you forgive me?
We must clean our class.
Jane is very content with her job and has no desire to quit it.
It occurred to me that he must have lost the money.
She was still a virgin.
I don't think that James would be here if he didn't have to be.
I can only keep a secret so long as no one asks me about it.
Why is no one here yet?
Doing that's illegal here.
He obviously likes her a lot.
I know that Jacob didn't know that you didn't have to do that.
Muhammad lives just down the street.
He warned the children against playing in the street.
Alex didn't think that he would make it.
I did that, too.
We'll take care of this for you.
Joe does good work.
I know exactly what you're trying to do.
Is it necessary for George and Julia to go by themselves?
Get out of here quickly!
You seemed interested.
The city was filled with panic.
Jacob and Susie said that they felt like getting drunk.
James tried to do that same thing Catherine was doing.
I'll try to finish writing the report today.
Why do Harry and Mary never smile?
That word dropped from his mouth.
Whatever happens, I want you to know that I love you.
You aren't yet old enough to drink, are you?
How're you all doing today?
To tell you the truth, I lost your pen.
Who's in there with you?
William is an expert in this field.
Adam's father is a policeman.
She never saw her sister again.
James and Anna immediately became friends.
After hearing the tragic news, he went outside to be alone.
I know that Alex would tell you how to do that if you asked him.
Are you really in control?
We could have a problem if Harry and Emma show up early.
I couldn't be happier for the two of you.
Jack thought he might have to do that.
Will you do the same?
There's only one thing that I really want.
I know that Catherine is more beautiful than I am.
Tommy wants to sell the farm.
And the evening and the morning were the third day.
Oscar has been wearing that same shirt all week.
This box is still empty.
Jack and Catherine were in Australia all last year.
I thought you weren't supposed to tell anyone about that.
I hope that that isn't the case.
I wish I could visit Boston.
We will soon be ready for the party.
A stranger approached him.
Why are you doing what you're doing?
Close that door!
I think that Jami wants me to go with him.
Joe can't really be as mean as people say he is.
Honey is sweet.
Why are you all so happy?
It wasn't easy for Charlie to tell Margaret what she needed to hear.
I suggest you do that by yourselves.
They'd help you if you asked them to.
When did you come up with such an idea?
Charlie let us know he needed to do that.
I decided not to drink.
Emma told me that she wasn't so sure.
They were good kids.
Oliver can convince anyone to do anything.
My grandmother can ride a motorcycle, and what's more, a bicycle.
My boyfriend likes pasta like me.
I have to go to the doctor today.
Nothing's good enough for her.
Why is James out here?
I think that Joe will come back.
What do James and Lucy have in mind?
Every time something unusual happens, I get blamed.
Muhammad made the announcement Monday.
Oliver has been out in the sun too long.
They said they didn't plan to go.
I have nothing in common with him.
I have some food.
She isn't so sure, is she?
Oliver is likely to be prepared, isn't he?
I'd do that again if Charlie asked me to.
I don't want your pity.
Who owns this ship?
You can't go in there alone.
When you really fall in all, you give your all. You surrender completely.
Who's going to do that for you?
He has been sitting there for two hours.
It's such a unique combination.
I love this sentence.
We've changed so many things.
Time runs on.
I just had a talk with your doctor.
I didn't think Jami would be the last one to do that.
He didn't want to call his lawyer.
You're going to laugh.
You're the only one here who doesn't know William.
Can you tell Jami that I'm here?
We've already decided that we'll go to Boston in October.
Harry and Laur are doing what they have to do.
She'd do that if she knew how.
He set out on a trip yesterday.
There was blood.
Alex wished he were dead.
This room has a king-size bed.
I know Jacob is a primary school teacher.
Oscar answered the telephone.
I woke up at eleven o'clock.
I think Oliver is having fun.
I kicked Charlie.
What are we having for breakfast?
Where's Boston?
We'll fail.
The district is short of water.
What on earth?
I don't think that you've done that right.
Happy fourth of July!
I need paint.
Muhammad said that he thought I was the only one who needed to do that.
I don't think Tommy would mind if we did that.
How do you handle complaints from neighbors?
Carmen said that she isn't tired.
I'd just like to talk with Jack before we leave.
I'm not the best person to ask.
Did you find his address?
I don't think that it's wise to do that now.
I'd like to wash up if I may.
I've spoken to Muhammad.
Did she say anything else about me?
Tommy has started doing that.
I'll have to tell them.
We'll need an extra ten dollars.
I just spent over three thousand dollars.
I can't jump over that ditch.
I saw some bodies.
He said in a telephone call he “could not be happier” with the discovery.
The cold is terrible this year.
I'm probably the one who'll do that.
What difference does that make to Jack?
Do you want to know why I didn't do that?
It's important that we do this correctly.
Adam said that it was bad.
I ran out of breath.
Charlie asked Eva why she needed to stay in Australia until Monday.
She's in boarding school in Florence.
I now regret saying that.
My briefcase is full of papers.
He says that he does that a lot.
Don't talk ... as if you know what it's like...
George is going to Australia this spring.
Alex and Susie still haven't told me why they had to do that.
Harry said that he knew he might need to do that on Monday.
I couldn't eat anything at all.
Oliver says Olivia has always lived in Australia.
You pay him well, don't you?
Why not let him try?
Alex said he thought that Eva was going to be able to do that.
I don't think it'll take long for me to fix that for you.
Oscar will wait for us.
You're not backing out now, are you?
Leave us alone.
He told me he could do that.
Am I going the right way?
Jack told Julia that he thought John was home every Monday.
We like it.
I was supposed to have done that by 2:30.
Susie bought her dream house.
I've done it again.
Oliver is very good at sports, but not very good at school.
Who told you I was going to do that?
George and Margaret think they can prove it.
Jami did that for his children.
Are you saying you don't want William to come to your party?
Sometimes I feel afraid of myself.
Oliver said Carmen knew that she might not have to do that again.
William and Lucy said that they waited until 2:30.
I know that George doesn't know why I didn't need to do that.
Why do people envy each other?
Almost all men hate something, but I am very good at being patient.
I had two dogs.
We often travel together.
I think that Muhammad could do that if he tried.
I'm pretty interested in doing that right now.
Didn't you know Muhammad didn't like baseball?
Doing that was the sensible thing to do.
I think Harry will try to kill Susie.
Their job is to clean the garage.
In my next life I want to be born as a deadly virus.
Do you have a pair of scissors I could borrow?
I think we shouldn't make a decision until we hear from Harry.
They will assist us.
The truth is I don't like her.
There is no time to spare.
James can't wait to see you.
Please tell Harry not to do that again.
Charlie and Lucy soon realized that they weren't alone.
Could you find out how to get there?
I hardly ever speak French anymore.
Joe's cooking.
Can't you stop him from crying?
You never listen, no matter how many times I tell you.
I didn't know that Tommy needed to do that today.
I'm not going to let anyone do that.
You've got to fight back.
If Charlie and Lucy were here, I wouldn't have to do that.
It has nothing to do with him.
I know Muhammad knew who did that for you.
Tommy and Susie decided to go to Boston by themselves.
I know Charlie won't wait for us.
Jami said that Julia was likely to be miserable.
Joe did what he felt he needed to do.
I've read in the newspaper about people who got shot for far less than what you've done.
Every question has an answer.
You can see a white tower over there.
I know that Muhammad didn't know that Carmen had to do that.
Do you know what that is?
We'll never reach London before dark.
I'm a student, but Charlie isn't.
Harry and Lucy aren't healthy.
Alex is obviously a good teacher.
I've never had a girlfriend.
I felt nervous with so many people watching me.
She walked her three dogs every day.
Tommy is a dangerous guy.
A man named Slim was killed in that accident.
Oliver said Mary is going to do that on her own.
He says he's good at cooking.
I watched Adam swim.
He wishes to become a doctor.
We are in grave danger.
Jack and Margaret wish they could speak French as well as John.
I want to get Tommy something nice for his birthday.
Muhammad can neither read nor write.
I don't think I'll tell Joe about this.
She has lost her car keys.
Ask Oliver to apologize to Catherine.
He said he'd try again.
Are you not hungry?
George isn't likely to know where Olivia lives.
You're always welcome at my place.
Tommy won't likely tell Anna he's hungry.
Charlie and Monica should never have tried doing that by themselves.
You don't entirely trust us, do you?
George wasn't ever in Boston.
Murderer!
I think we should wait until William gets here before we eat.
Charlie said that Mary was jealous.
I suggest you keep your opinions to yourselves from now on.
Why are you short with me?
I think I'm going to go inside.
I'm going to buy that painting.
I lost myself, as I usually do when I'm in a conversation.
You deserve a pay raise.
I didn't show them anything.
I'd rather you came tomorrow than today.
I can have so much fun just playing by myself.
Jack doesn't want to admit that Carmen was right and that he was wrong.
They didn't tell me they were married.
I know Oliver might ask Anna to do that.
A screen divided the room into two.
Oscar let us know that he didn't mind driving.
He works all night.
This lesson is boring.
James went inside the house.
They can understand everything I am saying.
Oliver shouldn't have asked Lucy to do that.
It hadn't crossed my mind.
William said that Julia wasn't studying French anymore.
Where did she find such an ugly hat?
I gave my old coat to them.
Don't blame this on me.
I couldn't ask for anything better.
I'm stronger.
This tree measures three meters around.
Alex and Lucy were sitting in their usual places.
Tommy thinks he knows everything.
You knew that James told Susie not to do that, didn't you?
He doesn't live there anymore.
She isn't likely to do that, is she?
Oliver, Valentina, John and Alice were all there.
Only a thief knows the ways of a thief.
Jacob told Monica that he had a cold.
Last night I dreamt I was eating bees.
I wasn't surprised that Muhammad didn't want to do that.
Monica will need at least $300 to buy what she needs.
I'll just wait here until Harry arrives.
We would like to eat the lunch together.
Give me some water.
I'm just learning how things work around here.
You've been a lot of help.
Oliver caught the ball with both hands.
I don't like it when you're so busy.
Alex didn't deny he was the one who stole Valentina's necklace.
Wouldn't you like to know why Muhammad didn't do that?
Joe doesn't know what has to be done.
I don't wish to debate this.
If you are a good boy, I will give you this watch.
I want to know when you'll arrive.
Why should I talk to Alex?
Adam doesn't smoke or drink.
I thought I told you I didn't want you to be here.
What is your favorite sound?
Keep notes.
I'll be thirty in a couple of weeks.
This part of the sea is deep and dangerous.
Don't hurt him.
I thought that you had a date with Alex.
I can't find my other glove.
My stomach has been hurting.
They say that they want to help you.
What have you done to me?
This is all he has to do.
Let me see what's going on in the next room.
Have you already booked our seats on a plane?
She always wanted love.
Oscar was my mom's dog.
I want to spend more time with Charlie.
Oliver doesn't think he can finish the job alone.
You'll let me know, won't you?
I have to do something before it's too late.
That isn't exactly what I intended to do.
It is true that he got full marks on the test.
I heard that Harry and Laur weren't at school today.
Someone must go with Jami.
It's difficult to have great ideas.
I wish you'd given me a little more notice.
Joe used to be successful.
No smoking.
There's no doubt that she'll visit England this summer.
Muhammad is well-known around here.
What time does Jack think we should leave in order to get to the airport on time?
The earth is blue. Like an orange.
Jami told Valentina that he thought John wasn't home.
He parked his car in front of the building.
Alex married her anyway.
Oscar thought both of Margaret's ideas were good.
It's out of the question.
She seems to be in trouble. Tell her what to do.
I'm not able to have children.
Oliver found a dead body in the woods.
Jami seemed unhappy.
Shouldn't Tommy be doing that outside?
You didn't know Harry didn't have time to do that, did you?
His technique was absolutely amazing.
I can't call the cops on them.
Bring an umbrella without forgetting.
I'm not sure where you live.
Muhammad said he thought I was funny.
I have no intention of discussing this further.
I wonder whether Oscar and Eva are still poor.
Please do what you consider necessary.
He may do as he likes.
It's a trap!
Joe thought he might not have to do that.
Don't move!
He lay down in a comfortable position.
He only did half of his homework.
Oscar has found another way to do that.
I hate cops like him.
I don't remember if I locked the door or not.
Jacob and Valentina are going to have to paint their barn again next year.
I received your letter yesterday.
How do you know Harry and Mary aren't going to do that?
I didn't think that Joe would get the job.
He says that he'll do that today.
They talked about their families.
I'd do that again if I had the chance.
When did she get married?
I run into all kinds of people in my line of work.
I don't like people.
It looks like you need help.
Fresh coffee will be ready in a minute.
It was Monica's turn to be shocked.
Mary said she'd only talk to Harry.
I hold you responsible for this incident.
You've been paid.
Is there any chance Oscar will agree?
Harry has a huge ego.
Jack couldn't answer my questions.
You aren't Adam's type.
I want you to get your own place.
Margaret will probably tell Jami she'll do that.
Can you survive on your salary?
Something extraordinary happened.
James thought that he had plenty of time to catch his plane, but he only just made it by the skin of his teeth.
I can do anything I want to.
It isn't good to eat between meals.
This was all free.
I don't think that this shirt suits a red tie.
I know that it's highly unlikely I'll be able to convince you that you're wrong.
This car looks angry.
I put on a sweater.
She said that she'd go to church.
Nothing's happened yet, but I'm sure it will.
You need to think for yourselves.
Julia said she didn't need any more time.
Security is still a concern.
How many passengers are on this plane?
We're all sure of that.
Take two.
I didn't think you would show up.
William asked me what I'm thinking.
Take a short walk every day.
I didn't know you were planning on doing that when you were in Boston.
I guess I needed someone to blame.
I hope we see you again soon.
Some didn't want to discuss.
Oliver thinks that Catherine doesn't want to do that.
Harry and Olivia said they were unlikely do that.
Charlie is a really rich person.
If you've caught a cold, then don't come to school.
Jami is stealing.
Muhammad didn't want to get arrested.
She was very active with her children.
Catherine has lost her keys.
What should I do, Charlie?
Charlie was a teacher.
George said he wished he hadn't given Anna any money.
I can often hear my neighbors arguing.
Your birthday's coming up.
I knew Charlie was here.
It's easy to get lost.
You didn't tell me that you were a doctor.
Mary couldn't find her left shoe.
Try to get the story straight.
I'm the one that ought to do that.
Did it ring?
It is the behavior of the control group that is important in this connection.
We won't know.
They said that they'd be able to do that.
I felt lonely.
James told everyone that he had been abducted by aliens.
They didn't notice the increase in noise.
It was nice of him to help.
He grew up to be a great scientist.
If you don't want to be here, you don't have to stay.
I bought a hat in the shop.
Julia knows this.
You know where to find me if you need me.
I joined the golf club three years ago.
Tell me what you did to her.
Joe's French is getting better.
What are you doing wearing William's clothes?
You must take the second street on the right.
Harry is cooking now.
Wow, look at this.
I could've sworn I heard something.
We have to make do with what we've got.
We've got to stop her.
I need to figure out what's going on.
We are his children.
For all I knew, William could be dead.
Does the medicine act on the stomach?
Alex told me I'd never win again.
Give me my pen back.
I want this fruit.
How's everybody?
Now I'm having fun.
Joe let the secret out.
This coffee is good.
I met an old woman.
This is a fork.
Good day, my sweetheart! Why are you still in bed? Are you sick?
Alex ripped the page out.
Another war, and we all will be killed.
I'm a huge fan of yours.
Tommy told me about what you did.
Does Adam live here with you?
Oliver was the only one who could do that.
Was it really that bad?
According to one story, the money was round so that it could roll from place to place.
She's a woman now.
George is the one who told me why I needed to go to Australia.
I'll remember you forever.
I'm glad to be back.
William will do that today as well.
It sounds lovely.
I think William and Laur aren't serious.
I begged Oliver for mercy.
James isn't at school.
So what's next for William?
We haven't found a solution to that problem yet.
They said that they'll be doing that soon.
It is time you went to school.
I have eaten a lot this morning.
Jami is looking for them.
I don't eat as much as Muhammad and Valentina do.
Eva said she'll be ready to go by the time you get here.
My car is in the parking lot.
Nothing but a full apology would satisfy him.
Is that your daughter?
George isn't quite finished yet.
Joe never saw any wolves, but he could hear them.
Let me call my lawyer.
How can I turn off this light?
I can't call her.
I see an old woman under the tree.
You should tell Susie that you love her.
We've got more money than they do.
I know that Joe doesn't know Monica shouldn't be doing that.
I go swimming about twice a week.
He looks a good deal better today.
I was really worried about you yesterday.
I see a boy.
Everything was completely black.
Who was Adam dating back then?
Jami is going to be jealous.
I'm a little cold.
Please ask to see if it's OK if we do that.
I knew George wouldn't be late.
Are you suggesting that I've made an error?
I never should've taken it.
When did you find out?
I don't know what he's trying to say.
I've warned Oliver not to do that.
How did you come to school?
I need to know when to show up.
Are you feeling any better today?
Oliver has already decided he's going to say yes.
Harry wasn't wearing a Halloween costume.
You are way out of your league.
Jami has lost it.
I'm afraid of doing that.
Laur said she didn't think George had to do that again.
They're all excited to see you.
Jami is doing nothing wrong.
I thought you recognized her.
Who told you to bring me here?
William couldn't borrow as much money as he needed.
This ball is round.
What's your record?
Both drinking and smoking are bad for your health.
Joe died October 20th.
The room was cleaned by George.
Jacob wanted Susie to help him clean the house.
Jacob is allergic to house dust.
I suspect Muhammad and Eva are uncomfortable.
Jami and Valentina are going to visit Australia.
Margaret told me she was embarrassed.
She knows more than she's letting on.
Alex told Lucy and me that we should try to do it by ourselves.
I agree with some of what Muhammad said.
I regret that I can't help you.
Wait over there.
I want to be the one who makes you laugh.
He is not so much a professor as a TV star.
Just be careful with them.
Why don't you try calling William one more time?
Catherine and William go to high school.
Does the hat fit well?
I am going to the swimming pool.
I assume that boy who looks so much like you is your brother.
That's why I can not believe it.
Which guitar should I get?
Alex loved to help people.
I don't want to wait till the last minute.
Muhammad told me to sit down.
Alex talks to just about everybody that he passes on the street.
Look out! There's a truck coming!
William should tell Monica that he wants her help.
Are you worried about the promotion?
I haven't done very much this year.
They went back to their seats.
Charlie knows he can trust you.
We aren't like that.
Tommy said he could do nothing.
How does the paper feel?
You're the only one who did that, aren't you?
He gave a loud cry with pain.
Can't you keep your voice down?
I know Jack isn't ready to do that.
I didn't think that anybody really thought Tommy was busy.
I appreciate your efforts to help me.
I guess that that's what we all want to do.
You should work in the interests of humanity.
Adam started laughing when I told him what Alice had done.
They didn't even know how to write their own names.
Everything was stolen.
Thank you for the beautiful flowers.
I just want Carmen to know that we'll miss her.
I gave them all the information they requested.
I won't do that the way Oscar suggested.
Haven't you ever considered doing that?
We are noisy as a whole.
Jacob doesn't like talking to strangers.
Do you tell Charlie everything?
Jack is beginning to see why he should've paid more attention in French class.
The ground is still wet. As likely as not, the game will be cancelled.
Everybody laughed at his error.
The old woman is crossing the road.
I don't have that much money.
Charlie and Margaret did their best to persuade John not to tell their parents about the accident.
They said they didn't have a choice.
Why do you feel that way?
Apart from her temper, she's all right.
One more step and you're dead!
I hope it stops raining.
Charlie and Lucy announced their engagement today.
Honey, are you OK?
I was a rich man.
I hope all your dreams come true.
That's just what I want.
I sat next to Jack.
Don't let them run away.
Why don't you sit here a moment?
You must study English every day.
How can I stop George?
Crying is normal.
"Are you going to do that today?" "No, I'll do that tomorrow."
Didn't you know Adam was going to do that with Valentina?
Tommy buried his dog over there.
Let's help them solve their problems.
They ask her many questions.
They dropped out of school.
Always be grateful to your mother and father.
Oscar may win this time.
Margaret had a flu.
Jack and Eva told me they weren't injured.
It's not open for debate.
I don't like the way Harry talks.
Should I go with you?
Muhammad married a wealthy widow.
You are not a coward.
Every comment is unnecessary.
I've arranged your meeting with Oliver.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
She likes me and I like her too.
He is awkward in his manners.
I'm almost certain Jacob will ask Catherine to the prom.
She said she was furious.
Tommy thinks he's stronger than I am.
I want to try eating horse meat.
Carmen did that this morning so she wouldn't have to do that tomorrow.
I'm nothing like you.
You said she was kind and so she is.
You don't need to worry about us.
Didn't you know I wanted to do that?
I'm probably not as rich as you.
I think that that helped a lot.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
Joe admitted he didn't have any experience.
Is it true that Tommy will be taking your place?
Oliver said that he didn't think Emma would ever be able to do that.
Do you want to bring your family to Germany?
Why are you staying with Muhammad?
I'm sick of waiting.
I know William didn't know he shouldn't do that here.
I've been very lucky in my life to have met many of my favorite actors.
I'm a woman.
I don't think Tommy knows how many hours it'll take him to drive to Boston.
It wasn't reasonable.
Food will be ready soon.
I think Harry has been very lucky.
Adam says he had to do that.
Muhammad put in a good word for me.
They said they weren't broke.
Oscar isn't here yet, but we expect him soon.
It goes without saying that English is an international language.
The police are trying to get entirely rid of drunken driving.
I've got a package for you.
He's confident he'll win, isn't he?
Neither James nor Carmen has ever tried to do that.
You need to ask Jacob and Valentina what they'll do.
Here comes Sarah.
Jami drove Susie home from work.
You're a lot like me.
If you are interested, let us meet again tomorrow.
I have to do the best I can.
Let's let the workers go home early today.
I'm not a psychic.
We're not working for Oliver.
Do you ever think about them?
We went walking on the shore of the lake.
I'm dealing with the problem now.
My uncle lived in Washington, D. C. for two years.
I'm a human being.
I cut my right hand on a piece of glass.
We missed you last night.
I don't plan to do that until I have to.
The ceremony was recorded.
Carmen put on her coat and went out.
I'm afraid of my boss.
Don't try to catch the dog. It's dangerous.
Was it you who told Margaret she doesn't have to do that?
I haven't seen you here before.
I wish Jami were here in Boston with us.
Oliver is convinced that everyone hates him.
Bringing up a child demands patience.
Why don't you go watch TV while I cook dinner?
The sky today is blue, without a cloud.
She might return.
Oscar is going to follow you.
I wonder if Tommy and Catherine are having fun.
I was more than surprised at the terrible sight.
I didn't like the way that movie ended.
I heard otherwise.
The temperature was thirty degrees this afternoon in Boston.
The resources of the earth are limited.
Try to be a bit more modest.
Margaret doesn't seem to understand why she has to do that.
Come on, let's try it.
William arrived from Australia yesterday.
The sword can be used to protect the body.
I know Harry and Alice have both been arrested.
I like bacon.
Is this going to be a problem?
I don't think that William knows what I want him to do.
I was afraid of catching a cold.
Joe would've gone to Australia if he could've.
Not everybody can be an artist.
Do you think Oliver is still angry?
That's how it is done.
That was bad.
She lifted her arms.
Please don't use Facebook during business hours.
Oliver said that he was full.
I've never told anybody about Joe.
I don't blame you for getting angry.
I know Harry and Emma both have houses in Australia.
Hopefully it will rain tomorrow.
Oscar has lost thirty pounds.
Stop pushing.
Tommy can ski as well as his brother.
I can come in early.
George spends a lot of time on his computer.
Oscar said that he was looking forward to being retired.
He is good at cooking.
I've been told that I'm required to do that.
It's really hot there.
Carmen said she didn't need to do that today.
Oscar is very happy indeed.
She claims she did that.
Ask James if he can speak French.
Are you sure your parents will allow you to go?
Jack made me happy.
Tommy said that he doesn't plan on going hunting again.
Joe was snoring.
They eventually turned themselves in.
I remember one fellow in particular.
I felt trapped.
Monica told me she thought she could do that.
Alex is kind.
It'll be easier for me to do since I have the right tools.
How long do we need to stay here?
Both Muhammad and I are blind.
Being very rich, he thought he could do anything.
Why does Oscar look so tired today?
Now you're talking, Oliver.
I told Harry to get home before Monday.
She said that she felt like crying.
"Let us begin today's lesson by opening our books to page 156," said the teacher.
We haven't been together that long.
The glass is clean.
My e-mail address has been changed.
I know that Charlie knows why you don't like to do that.
They say they needed to study French.
All the students study English.
I had a nice time.
I thought Harry would do well.
I don't think Alice would be doing that if she didn't have to.
Don't raise your voice.
You aren't a mechanic, are you?
Did you see what happened yesterday?
I think that you should do that by yourselves.
You're the perfect woman for me.
Jacob said he wanted to know if I could swim.
Jami still works at the same restaurant where Alice works.
We did what we could.
Alice could do what she needed to do.
Jacob has a good chance of winning the election.
George has more money than brains.
I don't think Muhammad is interested in doing that.
I suspect that Alex cheated.
I don't think Harry saw what we were doing.
Eva says she didn't want to do that.
Harry said he wasn't expecting Olivia to do that.
George and Mary take good care of their horse.
How do you know this is a fake?
It's not very often that someone buys a thousand dollar hat.
Oliver and Laur said they were curious about that.
She stuck a poster on the wall.
At that time, Muhammad was really hungry.
I'll go and buy some chocolate.
Shall I follow you?
I happened to be on the same train as Jack and Laur were.
Tommy has never asked me to help him.
I wear the same size shoes that George does.
You need to stay where you are.
I want to go abroad.
They said that they're glad you're coming.
Get your life together and grow up.
Alex said that he was going to be here.
That river is long.
The weeks pass like dreams.
This is a small border town.
He is free from pride.
I was brought up in Australia.
Oliver asked Mary to be more careful the next time.
"Fire!", he cried.
Joe asked Catherine to check it out.
I never talked to Adam.
We've given George another chance to do that.
I'm not very good with children.
Adam and Laur always get to work early.
I don't know what to do this evening!
I realize Muhammad could easily have done that.
James is older than all of us.
The church bells are ringing.
Jack didn't need to take a taxi. He could have walked.
Don't cheat.
Tommy and Laur told John they thought it was time to go home.
People in the village still talked about the horrible way Muhammad had died.
He kissed her farewell.
We're going inside.
His health is changing for the better.
Do you sometimes wake up feeling tired?
I hope you know that.
They aren't wearing their glasses today.
Could you give this to him?
William has a poor sense of direction.
She should've done that herself.
He has only one servant to attend on him.
The actress has a very beautiful name.
Those are values that we all share.
I don't usually watch war movies.
I'm reading your book.
That was a very nice lunch.
"I wanna have a word with you." "Sure, what is it?"
What I need is a beer.
I'll go see if Muhammad and Olivia are OK.
Please stay quiet.
Oliver thought he might be required to do that.
You look great in this picture.
All the students like holidays.
I can't tell you how many times that has happened to me.
I'm sure Oliver hasn't forgotten about us.
I won the bet.
I don't know much about painting, but I can tell that this brush has an excellent stroke feel to it.
My mom told me not to get into trouble.
I didn't think George would like this place.
It's what I was born to do.
Adam works part-time as a bartender.
George says Carmen still needs help.
We're going to send you home.
Oscar and Valentina told John that they thought Alice was suspicious.
I met them at a party.
Try to keep up your spirits.
I couldn't turn down the job they offered me.
I think the sentence would sound more natural like that.
I don't really have to do that, do I?
I think it would be really good for you to attend that meeting.
I know George is a difficult person to deal with.
Monica would've liked to attend William's party. Unfortunately, she had other things she had to do.
He refuses to believe us.
Emma was thirty when she died.
How good a singer is Harry?
Dinner will be waiting.
How could it have happened any other way than it did?
I know that you're smarter than that.
I know that Oliver saved Margaret's life.
It is essential to reserve your seat in advance.
They ski.
Joe and Alice said they didn't want to leave.
Thanks, Charlie. You've been a big help!
We are responsible for your protection from now on.
Ken is waiting for the train to come.
The economy still hasn't completely recovered from the financial crisis.
George died in October 2013.
I'm surprised that Jack never mentioned you.
The bus will arrive within ten minutes.
The sun burns my eyes.
Alex didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
William said he'd be at this afternoon's meeting.
I don't think that Joe knows the whole story.
You just have to know that it works. You don't need to know how it works.
As an American, I find that offensive.
She says that she will come tomorrow.
I'm enjoying my time here.
I think I'd better be quiet.
Call an ambulance!
James raised his son on his own.
Is there a gas station around here?
I hated every minute of it.
William didn't see it coming.
Did you see anybody else in the park?
George felt somebody touch his shoulder.
I'm not sure that I want William working for us.
James and Margaret told me they'd call me.
Why did you want to go to Boston?
Jack knew he didn't have much time left.
It took exactly an hour.
They want us to die with them.
I should have listened to William's advice.
Put these dishes inside the drawer, please.
This carpet is beautiful.
I nearly wet myself when I saw the scene with them.
I still have a few friends in Australia.
I didn't know Oliver was tired.
He said that he'd never do that.
How did we get ourselves into this?
He isn't my cousin.
I'm going to sell my car.
That's too soon.
What did Adam reply?
Laur actually figured it out by herself.
He turned over a calendar.
I still have another sister.
You'd do that again, wouldn't you?
She is writing a new book this year.
Adam wanted to be the one who did that.
Muhammad and I have been close friends for a long time.
Oscar did everything we asked him to do.
I like perfume tea.
Police was armed with a search warrant.
How did you end up in foster care?
Perhaps Charlie can speak French.
I traveled abroad twice in my youth.
Why does everyone always say that?
Tommy walked Carmen back to her apartment.
He never turns up without making a fuss.
I didn't tell Muhammad about you.
Can you get a ticket for me?
I'm out of my element here.
I just saw you guys three days ago.
Alice wasn't convinced that she could do that.
I was badly injured.
You don't seem to be enjoying the party.
Carmen sorted her laundry.
Alex put the diary in the drawer.
It's really hard to choose.
I don't think married people should have secrets from each other.
At least they listened to what we had to say.
Alice realized she was in deep trouble.
She sleeps on her stomach.
Are you going to let this fried chicken go begging?
We haven't seen you for a while.
I like to travel and meet new people.
He is pleased with his new car.
He looked like he was upset.
If I were rich, I would do so. As it is, I can do nothing.
I was looking for a pair of scissors.
I saw you flirting with Harry.
I knew Harry would kiss Anna.
I doubt that Jami is still interested in doing that.
I'll talk to her about that.
Let's keep this between us.
If you take a nap now, you will have a dream; but if you study now, you will realize your dream.
Oscar didn't like Mary's advice.
We've got a situation here.
Why didn't Jack help Alice?
Joe said he didn't think that he was good enough for Valentina.
It took us a long time to make this decision.
I have a heart problem.
It was clear that Joe didn't know that you were the ones who had done that.
The weather was lovely when I left home.
Did he hit you?
I don't see this as a major issue.
Harry hopes that Mary can take care of herself.
George isn't likely to allow you to do that.
I wonder if Oliver is really asleep.
Are you helping her?
I've tried to do that.
I'll send for you.
I'm usually better at reading.
You have three chances to spare.
Please fill in your name and address on this form.
I think this is the best plan.
Which prince is the legitimate heir to the throne?
I'm sorry that I forgot to tell Oscar what to do.
I made my way through the crowd.
Don't run, walk slowly.
Jacob and Valentina are really drunk.
Have you picked a name for the baby?
I thought I could help you.
Monica was dressed in leather.
I'll see them around.
George said that he thought that he might be required to do that today.
Jack kept me waiting all morning.
Why don't you try to get your money back?
I think Jacob would have been here today if he'd known Lucy was going to b here.
No one knows William as well as I do.
I wasn't asking your permission.
George has to pay his rent today.
What came first: the egg or the chicken?
He has already said yes.
James told me that he wanted to do that by himself.
Julia told me that she's miserable here in Boston without Adam.
They look like they're a bit tired.
I just got engaged.
The Bible tells us to love our neighbor.
They were a team.
What's wrong with Boston?
Tommy didn't know how to get to Mary's house.
Bill accepted my statement as true.
I don't know how to play the piano.
Laur locked her door.
I've never thought about doing that.
I can't believe you're actually doing that.
Alex knew Lucy had a roommate.
I didn't think I'd get arrested.
They ignored him.
I'm a good sailor.
I talked to Eva today about what she plans to do.
Don't forget to tell Susie not to do that.
Jacob stayed here three days last month.
She sang very well.
Jack really needs a vacation.
Muhammad says that you deserve a chance.
James thinks that we're dead.
Is Oscar tall?
I don't want anybody at all.
The wind blew her hair into her eyes.
James thinks people shouldn't eat in public.
In my anxiety to pass the test, I studied all night.
I hope I get a chance to visit Australia.
I found him working in the garden.
I don't approve of your going out with him.
He couldn't keep his temper any longer.
The teacher looked over the exam papers.
Shall we go and do that?
We fixed the date for our class reunion.
The dough is stuck to the counter.
George doesn't seem to understand why he shouldn't do that.
It's necessary to wait just ten days.
God is good.
They said they'd do anything for you.
You hope Oscar will want to do that, too, don't you?
Your new hat is very becoming on you.
I'm not used to doing that yet.
I helped Alex up the stairs.
They forgot to pay their phone bill.
I know what I like.
They say they'd be willing to help us.
You're exhausted, aren't you?
You can watch TV after supper.
She was the first one to notice him.
I think William and Mary aren't going to do that, either.
Put it back in the nest.
Who's responsible for this problem?
Don't you think we'd better stay here?
I am going to go to America next year.
No beer before four!
William rode his motorcycle across America.
He told me he was done, too.
I want to see what you have inside your house.
I don't make mistakes very often.
I wonder whether George and Eva are hungry.
We wanted to be a part of it.
Muhammad will be going to Boston soon.
How much money do you have?
Don't let them fool you.
He is the chief of a police station.
My brother often cries.
I have the impression that she has fallen in love with me. What should I do?
Was it you who told George he didn't have to do that?
We are fed up with studying.
Muhammad seemed like a real nice boy.
Those children were being cared for by an aunt.
They wished that they had more friends.
Do you really think that William is cute?
Jami said that he thought that it would be better if we didn't do that.
Please tell me what the rules are.
Charlie didn't seem to be very happy, did he?
Joe said that he thought I looked like I was bored.
William said that he had been asked a lot of questions.
Alex and Catherine both like riding horses.
Will you go to Boston with them?
My mouth went dry.
I'll be careful.
I'm near the station.
I assured Jacob that I wouldn't do that.
Alex and I used to work together in Australia.
I'm afraid that we've got quite a problem here.
Jami had never imagined that Susie would react this way.
He was not exactly thrilled to see her.
Joe and Alice said that they were very unlucky.
It's not official.
Alex's gamble seems to have paid off.
That's outrageous.
She took her secrets to the grave.
I know Jack is a jealous man.
I didn't know William very well.
That book was interesting.
I like autumn best.
If you hadn't done that, James wouldn't have gotten upset.
Do you want to talk to her?
Oliver and Emma don't go to the movies as often as they'd like to.
It’s fate.
That burger was terrible!
I just love everything about Jami.
What did you study?
Catherine said she was willing to help us.
She lives in the United States.
I cannot possibly come.
This isn't what William and I are looking for.
I'm the one who usually does that.
Who's going to the party?
You don't need to come tomorrow.
I walked to the window and looked out.
I can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke.
How long does it take to get to Boston from here?
Alex told me he'd be finished doing that by dinner time.
We can hear the dog barking.
I won't go there again.
Susie says she'll never give up.
I'm truly touched.
Everybody panicked.
Jami didn't want the party to end.
Water changes into steam.
Smiles do not always indicate pleasure.
Did he say anything before he died?
I should've figured William would be late.
I told you not to go by yourself.
I hated doing that.
Tommy pretended that he didn't care.
Olivia told me that she called you.
I must find a way to help them.
I picked Jack up after work.
I saw her at the party.
What should we do today?
You're just in time. Joe is almost ready.
Joe really wants to lose weight.
How do you know the difference?
I eat three times a day.
Mum is playing tennis now.
Why do you think Muhammad and Olivia won't do that by themselves?
Another!
I want to show it to James within the hour.
Jack probably doesn't know Lucy well enough to know what she'll do.
I don't think that I was followed.
Jack kissed Carmen because he liked her.
I'd like to know who it was who did this.
Do what you can for Jacob.
Jami said that he saw Carmen eating a sandwich in the park.
I liked working with Oliver.
Tommy asked Julia to tell John what he needed to do.
Could Jacob do that?
Joe and Mary say they didn't know they had to do that.
Where are your keys?
He told me that he wanted to cry.
I think Oliver doesn't know where Catherine lives.
We should leave quietly.
I'll tell him to contact you.
They didn't touch anything.
There is no hurry.
Do you have bread for lunch?
It's really cool looking.
If you stay, I'll stay.
Did you really think I wouldn't help you?
I have no intention in arguing about your theory.
Oliver should've lied to Eva about where he'd been.
I think that still needs work.
Why did you give Alex so much money?
I didn't want to admit I didn't know how to do that.
Muhammad almost hurt himself trying to do that.
It is no use your holding me back.
He promised he wouldn't be late.
I'm here on a trial period.
We'll show them.
Have a good weekend, everyone.
Leave him with me.
I'd like to meet her.
I really do wish you'd leave.
How would you resolve such issues?
Why doesn't Tommy drive anymore?
I think Adam would be mad if you did that.
Jill has been on the phone with friends for more than two hours!
I doubt that Tommy and Lucy are still hungry.
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?
Why should Adam visit Australia?
The busy mother told the children to run along.
I study math harder than you do.
Really? Are you serious?
Joe said he liked teaching French.
She thinks that she should do that.
I wasn't sure whether Harry and Monica were still asleep or not.
I like being in Boston.
Jami says he won't buy that for you.
In the name of God, protect me from this crazy woman!
She knew she'd done something stupid.
I didn't catch the meaning.
I think Jacob and Carmen are coming to Boston next weekend.
I definitely need some more money.
He has a little money.
I told you nothing else but the clear truth.
Dan didn't even read the instructions.
What a cock-up!
I know what's happening.
They said they'd love to go with us.
I take it you haven't heard from Charlie.
I assure you, everything's fine.
I feel amazing thanks to Oliver's special orange juice.
I'm amazed at Jacob's nerve.
Harry wouldn't comment.
How much do police officers make?
Jami is the only person who should have done that.
Jami is sexy.
Joe is screaming at somebody in his office.
I hope Harry doesn't do that.
We have not found the girl.
The story was so complicated that I couldn't follow it.
Jack doesn't think Catherine would like to do that.
She turned over the page with excitement.
At that time, James didn't know that Anna was the one he'd eventually get married to.
Are you really enjoying yourselves?
Are you ready for Y2K?
I still don't need to do that.
We're not all as old as you are.
Don't make that expression.
I'm not Joe.
I'm not experienced enough.
Do you really think William and Julia are well?
This is the picture Oscar painted.
You are home.
I thought that we were welcome here.
Don't forget to breathe.
We can't let it get out that Tommy is seeing a psychiatrist.
Joe laughed at his own joke.
We didn't let Tommy sing.
This news report created a lot of confusion.
I didn't have time, so I didn't do that.
Charlie takes a bath every evening.
I don't want to waste time talking to George.
How can Oliver help Carmen?
I'm almost certain we can trust James.
There was a bus schedule on the wall.
I'm sure Joe can speak French.
I doubt Tommy's abilities even though I'll admit he's honest.
The chair is not by the window.
She treated his wound.
George is really tall.
Look it over.
Why don't you come dancing with me?
"Who wrote this book?" "John did."
What movie is this?
We can't tell you anything.
You'll have to tell me all about Monica's life.
Anna says she plans on staying where she is.
Would that make you feel any better?
We will get there in two hours.
Joe appears nervous.
How often do you go to church?
I haven't really been there.
She gets to do whatever she wants to.
You ought to have told Oscar you were sorry.
Oscar is in the perfect situation.
I'm pretty sure Oscar's healthy.
Charlie is getting the boat ready.
I'm never going to give up.
I was left alone.
Harry said that he would be at the meeting.
How long have you been learning English?
I'm going to have to get some more money out of the bank.
Oliver is very well known.
There was no time left for explanation.
This is a picture of you.
Next year's conference will be held in Boston.
Tommy didn't call Susie, did he?
James will be unable to finish doing that in an hour.
Will Catherine do that by herself?
Why are you sitting here in the dark?
George needs to be in Boston next Monday.
Of course, I have to tell her.
Oscar seems to be getting his strength back.
It's probably OK to do that.
I couldn't do that anytime soon.
I believe you're mistaken.
He didn't know what he had to do.
You've never done that, have you?
There is nothing wrong with you.
Muhammad did that in a hurry.
The young lady has less fruit than the man.
I have eaten a whole cow.
This box contains apples.
I thought that I was about to be captured so I ran as fast as I could.
He has something else on his mind.
I'll help you after lunch.
Adam told me he thought that Laur had been unfair.
No one's seen her.
What have I been doing all my life?
I thought I heard him come in.
Harry always makes a funny face when I point the camera at him.
It is not forbidden by law.
Aren't you going to be here?
There is some milk in the bottle.
A long tongue is a sign of a short hand.
I don't think that I'd like living in Boston.
What's Tommy going to say about that?
Julia realized she'd forgotten to lock the door.
Muhammad says he wants to show Alice something.
I don't like to throw anything away.
We think this belongs to you.
I have a lot of ideas.
That's where Jacob and Monica live.
You've got nothing to apologize for.
Jacob is quite intelligent.
We're still not allowed to visit Oscar.
Anna said Adam thought she was the only one who wanted to do that.
Joe wanted to kiss Carmen then and there.
Muhammad was injured playing soccer.
William and Mary have a lot of things they need to buy.
I only spent three dollars.
Harry told me that he didn't have any money.
George said that he paid thirty dollars for that shirt.
I didn't agree to help him.
You can read between the lines.
Would you like to improve your French?
You aren't expected to do that.
It seems that anything can happen today.
Oliver wrapped himself in his blanket.
He told me that he spoke French.
How many people are here?
I've heard you're leaving Australia.
I don't think that it would be wise to argue with Joe.
All right.
I work in a bank.
Jami doesn't remember much.
It probably would've been dangerous to do that by yourself.
You drive like a maniac!
She said she'd quit doing that.
James and Carmen soon realized that they had made a mistake.
I didn't think that William would help Emma do that.
William knew Susie didn't have to do that anymore.
They helped Harry.
I'm sorry, but I really have to go.
Charlie wouldn't be happy if we let Carmen do that.
You are really a hopeless idiot, aren't you?
Were it not for your help, I should fail.
He's my most interesting friend.
I don't think that James knows for certain when Margaret will be arriving.
Adam says that he can't help.
I don't get many visitors.
Alice says she has a lot to do.
Adam and Margaret haven't told John what they have to do yet.
I don't understand my feelings.
Autumn is here.
It was a riot.
Hi. My friend over there is shy and he wants to know if you think I'm cute.
I thought that you said you were going to be in Australia this week.
Adam has got to be kidding.
Is there a message?
I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.
James really should be in Boston by now.
Oscar suggested that we have a farewell party for Carmen.
You are not at all wrong.
Julia turned on her computer.
We must come up with a plan.
I asked them what was wrong.
John writes a letter to his parents once a month.
Why can't we do it now?
You're supposed to be doing something else, aren't you?
Don't go further down that road.
Joe and Laur couldn't persuade John to accept their gifts.
Always be smarter than people who hire you.
You mustn't tell that to your parents.
He loves soccer.
Jacob made a cup of tea for Lucy.
Oliver and Eva told me that they're getting married.
Don't you want to get back with Jami?
He lives by himself.
If you say, "I love you," then I will also say that to you.
What is it with you, Jacob?
You'll never get away with this.
Where can I get hold of a good tax lawyer?
I believe he was murdered.
Oscar said that Margaret is cold.
Alex said that he was happy to see you.
I'll just say it once: there isn't and there's not going to be anything between us.
I suspect that Jack and Emma don't like me much.
I'm afraid that I can't make it at that time.
I'd like to know why Jacob didn't do what he said he'd do.
I'm not sure Boston is where I want to be right now.
They don't need one yet.
I received a ball for the doll.
I suspect Harry and Monica are in Australia now.
William and Laur told John that they didn't think Alice was drunk.
We want to hear from you.
Joe doesn't look too good.
It was really intense.
I hope Tommy and Emma know why they don't need to do that.
"Where will we go for lunch?" "Jacob, you decide. I can't. "
William and Laur never told me that they were married.
Eva says she's planning on doing that.
Was your father wearing a sweater last night?
James is willing to do that, but Monica said he didn't need to.
Jami has got to do that.
No, I'll never lie to her.
I'll phone you every night.
Jacob reminded Carmen not to be late.
I think we shouldn't let Susie go to Boston by herself.
I did that right, I think.
She said she had a wonderful time.
The food here isn't fit to eat.
I got injured doing that.
Muhammad can't give it to you now.
The rain lasted five days.
Oliver had nothing more to lose.
No one has seen me.
I'm just finishing up the report.
How well do you know Boston?
The town was established in the 18th century.
His knowledge of French is poor.
Hey, you're not Harry.
Harry's three sons still live in Australia.
What did you find in his pockets?
If you don't want to attend the meeting, you don't have to.
Who is the pretty girl sitting beside Jack?
The prince thought the young girl had been eaten by a dragon.
I don't remember what happened.
How many people here do you know?
Charlie cooked us a delicious meal.
How about starting again from the very beginning?
I cannot but admire him.
How many times have you done that so far?
Adam says that he'll come tomorrow, but I doubt he'll actually show up.
Alex'll help.
It's a question for the public.
My name is Charlie Jackson.
Jacob told me that he couldn't walk.
I don't want people to hate me.
Jacob's band is back together.
I heard you.
Lucy wishes she had straight hair.
Could you please tell me how to do this?
I forgot that Charlie was your boyfriend.
It's pretty clear what's going on here.
I saw a steam-ship yesterday.
He only does that when he's drunk.
I'm going to be here for a couple more hours.
Wonderful!
I thought Joe could do that by himself.
Even if you aren't hungry, you should eat something. Otherwise you won't last until lunch time.
The others weren't so lucky.
I don't like being told to hurry.
Where is your dignity?
They're still just friends, right?
I thought that you might want this back.
I think we'd better go.
I wish we were still in Boston.
Harry remains on probation.
Hardly had I met her when I fell in love with her.
William and Catherine showed up in Boston three days after they said they would.
I was thinking of leaving.
Adam asked Olivia why she had never studied French.
The government has made efforts to make our country clean and green.
Children are really looking forward to summer vacation.
Jami said he thought that he could buy what Alice wanted for about $300.
I suggested to Muhammad the possibility that he work with Alice.
Alex said the case has been closed.
George and Anna are pleased with the way things have turned out.
I'm the one who told Alex that Alice's house had burned down.
Maria takes the children to school.
I don't come here as much as I used to.
I think Joe could talk Carmen out of doing that.
How do you manage not to love it?
We'll get you a place to stay.
I want to thank him.
Susie said that she's sure she won't do that.
Wouldn't it be nice if Muhammad didn't do that?
Being poor, they had to work hard.
Tommy wouldn't remember me.
Joe is a hockey fan, isn't he?
The first prize may be won by him.
I won't be busy this afternoon.
Harry is going to be at home this afternoon.
I'm the guy who showed James how to make tomato sauce.
Did Joe really make you do that?
Harry didn't tell me who to give this to.
Do you want to have lots of money?
Are Tommy and Emma still going to help us?
He goes fishing every other day.
Life has been very hard.
Will you move back here again?
You need to do whatever Jacob tells you to do.
She blamed John for the damage.
How do I know that you're telling the truth?
This noise is something which I refuse to put up with.
I don't believe they would do that.
Everyone at the party was drinking wine.
I still don't have enough money to buy that.
I think we shouldn't let Muhammad play with Valentina anymore.
Olivia does that, doesn't she?
I didn't believe it, either.
I want to see what's going to happen.
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
I don't think that William is a loser.
James knew Carmen didn't need to do that.
I came just to see what you're doing.
Could you suggest an alternative date?
The rain didn't last long.
I wish I didn't need to do that this week.
He ought to do that by himself.
Alex has been studying all morning.
I just want you to tell me where James is.
He's dark and handsome.
We need more employees.
I lived in Australia until 2013.
I was excited and nervous at the same time.
What are you using for bait?
Jack turned left onto Park Street.
Charlie is still not sure what has to be done, is he?
The meeting is obviously over.
It falls on Sunday.
Alice said she thought Joe wouldn't do that.
I guarantee that this information is correct.
William and I studied French together.
No matter how hard Oliver tried, he couldn't impress Monica.
Charlie has been allowed to drive.
Jack and Eva have just returned from Boston.
You look like you've been doing something you shouldn't.
Don't you want to be near Alex?
I didn't think that Jack would do that on purpose.
Sharon must be a go-getter.
You've already convinced me.
That has never happened to me, touch wood.
I have plenty of time, so I can sleep for a while?
He presented her with a doll.
Muhammad decided to give it another try.
Alex visited Australia last summer.
He went abroad to study.
I don't understand the math.
I think that Jack is quite right.
My zoo is safe.
It's easy to understand why Jami and Margaret don't like it here.
Did you know what Jack's plans were?
He lives off the grid.
I'm not in love with him.
The older we get, the more we hear about things.
Olivia felt betrayed and humiliated.
Japan is here!
They are reading her book.
Tommy is really furious with the way things are going.
Do you have anything on for this weekend?
You bought rolls, I hope.
What are you a student in?
I didn't know Tommy really needed to do that anymore.
Jami says that he'll study French with Susie this evening.
If you want to leave, leave.
Charlie was grateful for your help.
I don't like to do the same things James likes to do.
Adam recommended not doing that.
Nobody wants to go to Boston with you.
I thought that you said that you were done with Jacob.
I know that you don't speak French.
You are not old.
James and Olivia say they hope John won't be afraid to do that.
No one expected Muhammad to win.
It happened three days after I got back from Boston.
I don't know what else I can do.
Charlie asked everybody to leave him alone.
I told Tommy to eat more vegetables.
Do you have any family?
I know Charlie is almost never home on weekends.
Alex said he was in love with Monica.
This is what we're up against.
Go to the store before it closes.
You own nothing in this house.
I know Oscar was lying to me.
I'm better off now than I was three years ago.
I don't see any bullet holes.
I count on your help.
Anna said she hopes Jack won't let John drive.
You're already big enough to do that by yourself.
I want to go to Australia with Harry.
I don't care about fashion.
This happened a long time ago.
Carmen is the lead singer of her band.
I think Joe may visit Australia on his next trip.
I actually didn't plan it at all.
I'm scared too, so I'm not going to go.
You'd better stay at home rather than go out on such a day.
He advanced me a week's wages.
Charlie pulled into the gas station and turned off his engine.
William has been planning on doing that.
I don't understand George the way you do.
Alex takes the bus to work if he's going to have a few drinks with his mates after work.
She hardly ate anything.
He always speaks to me when he meets me on the street.
Let me have the picture.
I would like to take a walk, but the day is too hot.
Did you enjoy yourself at the party?
Jami is likely to get charged.
Why did you talk to Jack?
How does he gain his living?
William says he's been beaten up three times.
It was a very cold winter.
Have an open mind.
Jacob and Susie haven't said what they might do.
George will have to get medical attention.
She fixed herself a cocktail.
I'd love to go back to Boston.
Eva wasn't told not to do that by herself.
Joe graduated from high school in 2009.
James wanted the money.
I'm not sure that that's a good idea.
When I first met her, she was nearly 30 years old.
Who doesn't do that occasionally?
I thought that I understood you.
Keep the paper in the inside pocket.
Can you recommend a good place to eat in Boston?
You're poisoning me.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle the job.
If you do not think about your future, you cannot have one.
Oscar drank coffee, but Alice drank tea.
George thought he was going to be killed.
Don't make me come after you.
They said that you were their friends.
It's impossible to make out what he wrote.
He is not a man to deal with a lot of problems.
Now, why doesn't that surprise me?
Joe didn't tell me why he was avoiding Laur.
I'm glad you finally figured it out.
I could not catch a single word of their talk.
That's something Jacob has to do.
All you have to do is to pretend you are me.
They only did what they had to.
I told myself I could do it.
Charlie told Julia to pay attention.
Oliver had a worried look on his face.
Anna is liked by her friends.
The only ones here who can't go with us are Charlie and Emma.
You made Jacob unhappy.
They said that they might not do that.
I never said you were boring.
You should also listen to the other side.
We can not always tell the same lie to the people! Some day we'll have to imagine a new lie.
Adam is good at keeping secrets.
I wonder if I've done everything I was supposed to do.
England are about to win the Ashes.
Yelling and screaming isn't going to get you anywhere.
It matters not how many books one reads, but which books.
That movie is suitable for people of all ages.
He is an expert driver.
How much is the tax?
Alex didn't do that as quickly as he should've.
I didn't know that Alex would have to do that today.
This is illegal in the European Union.
I don't think Alex and Anna know how to cook.
I have enough experience points to level up.
Has John decided on a career yet?
You can accomplish this.
Just throw your bicycle in the back of the truck and I'll drive you home.
Oscar stood up and went to the door to let Mary in.
How much money did you lose today?
I recognized Valentina as soon as she walked into the room.
If you knew that somehow I was in trouble, ...
I requested extra salt on my french fries.
Alex would've succeeded if he'd worked harder.
I can't play chess.
Joe told me that Anna was nervous.
Just do it. You'll regret it if you don't.
It's not a little money.
She could've gone by herself.
William got home just before 2:30.
I don't think Oliver and Valentina really want to do that.
Charlie tried to calm the baby down.
I believe it to be him.
Charlie feels he has done his part.
I wonder whether or not James went to Boston.
I've already seen the film.
How many cookies did Alex eat?
They said they didn't know where to go.
I almost did that yesterday.
What does Muhammad plan to do now?
Jacob is the one who'll do the cooking.
I'm delighted to be here.
Harry gave Valentina a weird look.
I wish we had more of this kind of thing.
Charlie and Carmen were certainly enjoying themselves.
Please leave a message on my answering machine.
Don't ever lie to us again.
I want you to start studying French.
Oliver did everything for them.
Charlie has probably done this before.
Who eats bees?
We find ourselves in the twilight of our civilization.
William and Eva said they were feeling thirsty.
He will harvest his wheat in July.
That's an excellent point.
Is there someone following me?
Is Joe available now?
I don't think that we should tell anybody just yet.
This is the house where my father was born and brought up.
Margaret isn't yet able to swim, is she?
He did it for the money.
The last election was such a hot contest that several ex-ministers lost.
I will always love Julia.
I can't believe I made him cry.
George told Alice to stay out of his room.
She is very bright.
I didn't ask for your advice.
Your answer is correct.
Who else knew about it?
I know somebody who can help us.
What color tie did Jacob wear yesterday?
I'm not the police.
I thought you'd be outside on a day like this.
Jacob and Julia said that they didn't know where John lived.
Muhammad wanted to keep it a surprise.
Joe died alone in the desert.
An eagle flies in the sky.
Oscar is going to go to Boston next weekend.
James is out on the porch, talking to Susie.
I know what you told him.
But for my advice, you would have failed.
Don't take me seriously. I'm only joking.
She said that she felt safe.
She always works hard.
Jack stayed in the bathroom for a long time.
How will you stop me?
With a little more effort, he would have succeeded.
Tommy said that was the first time he'd tried to do that.
She said she was afraid to fly.
Now I recognize you!
It looks like Jacob and Laur aren't very happy.
Is your English getting better?
He did it all out of kindness.
She is in an awful mood.
The boy stayed quiet.
Tommy and Monica got everything they needed.
May I call around 2:30?
What time do you go to the airport?
I'm worried about Oscar's behavior.
The man standing by the door is a famous singer.
You're going out with someone, aren't you?
Muhammad stayed in his room by himself.
I'm here to take Adam home.
I was trying to make sense of what had happened.
You don't have to answer any of Jami's questions if you don't want to.
Which friends of yours are going to come?
Mary swore she wouldn't do that anymore.
He came with his parents.
I don't think you need to do that if you don't want to.
Why did Oscar spend time in prison?
I want to be sure Laur knows what she's supposed to do.
Oliver must make a decision soon.
He'll succeed in time.
It was very touching indeed.
Jacob was given a 20-week prison sentence.
It's just a hobby.
I'm clever.
I got up to greet them.
Alex said he suspected Susie would do that.
Neither Harry nor Anna has gone to the library.
James said that he knew what Catherine was planning to do.
Alex had trouble falling asleep.
Is the plane on schedule?
You're a very good liar.
I think that William will like the present you bought for him.
I never see this picture without thinking of him.
She was as great a scientist as ever lived.
Muhammad said he thought that would embarrass Valentina.
I wanted to hear from her.
I'll do anything to make you happy.
James said he wouldn't walk home today.
Did you get the eggs?
Alex lives in a three-bedroom apartment in downtown Boston.
I think we should do something stupid.
Once there lived a great king.
If you eat that you will die.
Oliver and Susie should never have tried doing that on their own.
She said that she's done.
You're doing fine. Just relax. Be yourself.
I'll be right down the hall.
Get them away from me.
You guys are right.
Help yourselves to some cake.
I am smart.
George said that Lucy was enjoying herself in Boston.
I told Harry to take off his shoes.
You can't tell George what to do.
I have watched all of her films.
It's about time somebody did something about this broken door.
I know that Alex didn't know Monica didn't need to do that.
I quit playing soccer.
I don't care what the doctor says: I will not give up hope that Harry will recover.
Oliver is really stupid.
I know Oliver doesn't know I should do that.
You must do that at once.
Do you really want to quit your job?
Alice said she just needed more time.
It was an awful accident.
Alex told Julia that she shouldn't go there by herself.
Discipline is the key.
Hi, the blue sky!
When did Charlie get back?
I know Adam used to be a soldier.
They said they didn't have any money.
I know someone has to do that.
Jami is slow to anger.
James is scheduled to leave tomorrow.
We've never been to Boston.
She paid all her bills.
Charlie and Olivia probably don't know how they're going to do that.
How did Adam get away with that?
Older men are usually very wise.
How pretty she looks in her new dress!
We're on the way home.
He is short, but good at basketball.
Would you put this in the safety deposit box?
Lovely day, isn't it?
How long does it take to walk from here to the station?
Tommy seemed to be unhappy yesterday.
At attention!
Have you ever been on a cruise ship?
Do you really think it would be safe to do that?
She was desperate for attention.
Who should go to Australia?
I can't remember exactly how old I was when I first met Oscar.
Last night I was at home.
I know Jacob knows why Laur is doing that.
He wants to be a husband at every wedding, and the deceased at every funeral.
They died while waiting to be rescued.
I'll see him in the morning.
That sounds like Jack.
James is going to be there in thirty minutes.
Give me my drink.
She says she's going to stop smoking.
Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.
Harry came over to my house last night.
I know how you felt about William.
Why did she ask this question?
James and I don't have kids.
I should've just stayed home and read a book.
You almost stepped on the dog's tail.
I know George almost never does that anymore.
I'm always forgetting things.
I haven't seen William since he and Olivia got divorced.
Always look on the bright side of life.
I don't like living here.
Harry is learning to deal with that.
I don't expect Tommy to help.
My father is busy as a bee every day.
This fruit doesn't taste good.
I think that's a bad idea.
What is the year of your car?
My mother was no less angry with me than my father.
Unfortunately, Jami won't be able to attend your party.
She apparently did that by herself.
You promised!
Sorry, you have the wrong number.
She would keep interrupting me.
I didn't know that you used to have a crush on me.
If I knew it, I would tell it to you.
George wasn't able to wake Valentina up.
That means nothing.
Do I look as bad as I feel?
I don't think George has that kind of money.
He looked about the house.
I knew you'd come, my darling.
These questions can be answered quite simply.
They won't tell me when they were born.
I don't agree with Charlie at all.
Oscar doesn't seem to be as relaxed as Lucy seems to be.
Adam said he doesn't think that Olivia will do that again.
If I can win the lottery, then I won't have to sell my daughters.
There is no word for liberty in the Russian language.
George says he's planning to go to Australia this winter.
Tommy and Eva have all kinds of problems.
She stole a lot of money from him, so now she is in prison.
I hadn't really noticed.
James and Eva's father doesn't allow them to drink wine.
I used to hate you.
I told you to wear a hat.
I feel helpless sometimes.
I have something that belongs to you. Why don't you come over and pick it up?
You have to help him.
I didn't know Joe had a house on Park Street.
This old fish has a strange taste.
Excuse me sir, could you spare some change?
I'm waiting for a response from her.
Tommy spoke up for Margaret.
Olivia hasn't made her schedule public.
Jacob and Susie are planning to move to Australia.
Oliver tried to win Susie's affection.
Oliver and Carmen say that they had to speak French.
They locked their door.
I thought Harry was scared.
Carmen knew she might not have to do that by herself.
I found the picture you were looking for.
I'd like to be alone if you don't mind.
I suppose she's got a point.
I know I shouldn't do that anymore.
I'm going to try to do that this afternoon.
Where did you get this information?
We need to stay calm until help arrives.
I'll play with you.
James pretended he was afraid.
The time is now.
James said he wants to join our band.
Musical talent can be developed if it's properly trained.
How much snow do you think we'll get?
Excuse us for just one second.
Emma said she thought Adam wasn't busy.
James can speak only a little French.
When is the breakfast served?
I'm not likely to be arrested for doing that.
If I lose your love, I lose everything.
Did you notice that she left home?
Carmen is in college, but her boyfriend is still in high school.
She asked me who had arrived first.
Adam dropped his suitcase and ran away.
George absolutely nailed it.
Apparently, this still doesn't work perfectly, but the system may still be of interest.
Isn't it neat?
It's against the rules.
Charlie has spent time in Australia.
Jacob made a great catch.
Oscar ought to visit Australia.
Jack isn't supposed to be here now.
William faces life in prison if he's convicted.
Please don't do anything else.
George is a man you can rely on.
No one heard Jami's screams for help.
She is not even a math teacher.
Let's return to the better Japan once more.
Tomorrow is the third.
I haven't been getting enough sleep lately.
Jami and Margaret were planning to do that yesterday.
If you decide to work for us, we will pay you twice as much.
I'll hide in here.
One thing that I don't like about Harry is that he never says thank you when you help him.
He made a speech in support of my view.
I don't know how to cook.
Adam won't have to do that again.
I bet Tommy is happy.
I was going to tell the truth.
What's wrong with that woman?
Tommy was robbed while walking late at night.
How long will you remain in Boston?
James and Susie are probably going to be forgiven for what they did.
It was yesterday that I went.
Harry shouldn't have told me.
Charlie and Catherine are both jealous, aren't they?
Tears came to her eyes.
I think you know who you need to talk to now.
I still think Harry will win.
That's likely not true.
Were they convinced?
I'm eager to go to Australia.
It was a good compromise.
Charlie and I'll go to Boston together.
Charlie made it clear he had nothing to do with that.
This shouldn't take too much time.
Muhammad and Laur said they'd be willing do that for free.
You need to learn how to swim.
I didn't see who was driving.
Anger is a form of madness.
I'm not as smart as James.
She should blame herself.
Could you translate this sentence for me?
Your son is playing with my tool. Tell him I need it here right now.
Alex won't listen to a word I say.
Charlie forgot to tell Monica to take the bread out of the oven.
I forgot to call them.
Eva wants to spend the rest of her life with Joe.
Did you ever break a bone?
William opposed the measure.
Who told you that Jami did that?
I never would have hurt you.
I am a mother.
I gave Alice something that I thought she'd like.
I want to be here for you.
You're good at that.
You look like you're alone.
I think Jacob won't be able to understand that.
Carmen wasn't impressed by what she saw.
Harry is really handsome, isn't he?
I was fool.
I still haven't bought everything we need.
We never had any intention of doing that.
I thought Charlie would ask Julia to marry him.
She said she isn't in any hurry.
I will never tell a lie from now on.
Why did you call us here?
I'm not going to yell at you again.
We were not invited to the party.
Why don't I just talk to Oscar?
I told you it wasn't mine.
See, that's going to be a problem for me.
Muhammad doesn't need to do that again.
Oliver was there for Susie.
My hair was still wet from being washed.
Don't get so emotional.
Harry didn't want anybody to find out about him and Margaret.
They're wearing expensive clothes.
Do you ever have a fever?
Jami is very sure that Carmen did that.
He took off his jacket.
What's the best way to eat this?
Perhaps we can discuss this later.
We must do that now.
He asked if I wanted to exchange money, and I said "no way".
Oliver and Eva are going to find out soon.
I am walking to the bathroom.
Charlie told me he wanted to do that alone.
Tommy probably doesn't know what to do.
He filled his bucket with sand.
He lives near the beach.
I asked Harry not to hurt anybody.
I thought you said Charlie would do that.
James has been convicted.
I've been living in San Francisco for some time now.
Los Angeles is one of the cities that I want to visit.
Go through the orange door.
It's good to see Oscar back.
She continued sobbing without looking up.
I doubt that Adam really has time to do that today.
Are you a student?
Jacob stayed in the shallow end of the pool.
He went on a walk.
Carmen introduced me to her new boyfriend yesterday.
That makes us happy.
All that you have to do is to wait for his reply.
It may already be too late for us to do that.
Jack kept me waiting for half an hour.
Joe used his knife to cut the rope.
Mary is crying right now, isn't she?
You should work now, you should go back to your machine.
Will you come tomorrow?
I thought Jack might know Emma.
I'm going to come back to pick Oliver up.
I wonder why Joe didn't come to school yesterday.
I don't think Joe would do something like that.
The Atlantic Ocean is very big.
Can your brother drive?
Can you tell me when Oscar got his driver's license?
Don't forget your ticket!
I thought that Jacob would be angry.
I don't really trust them.
How can I lower my high blood pressure without medication?
William said that they wouldn't allow him to do that anymore.
I didn't speak French.
I've decided I'm the one who should do that.
This woman has two bags.
Who looks after this dog?
You should exercise.
I'll talk to them tomorrow.
Jacob needs to be dealt with.
I need a clean cup.
About how many hours will it take to do that?
You didn't go by yourself, did you?
I'll get the truth from Jami.
Could you bring me something to eat?
Love is as important to me as money is to her.
This made me cry.
She blew herself up accidentally.
Harry tried his best to ignore Anna.
Tommy thinks that Valentina will be able to convince John to do that.
Oliver's funeral is on Monday.
I looked at the map on the table.
Can someone help me lift this package?
Don't blame yourself.
Adam said he knew he might have to do that on Monday.
Joe is still at Susie's.
I don't feel like part of the family.
I don't trust him any more.
That's OK.
Both Harry and I know the truth.
William told Eva he'd be doing that tomorrow.
Toss your gun on the ground.
I know that James and Valentina are friendly.
We're both named Adam.
I don't care where I work.
I'm glad to see you here.
Someone will be with you in a moment.
Good morning! Where do you want to go?
Everybody seems to be happy but you.
I tire easily.
I thought you were his friend.
Alex has been at this for a while.
How many years will it take Tommy to finish high school?
You will be busy tomorrow.
Margaret just needs to do her job.
I think that a lot of people will end up doing that.
Is it this hot every day?
Where is the pine forest?
Marie painted.
Did you tell William how much fun you had?
I knew that William was used to getting up early.
I'm not really sure where to begin.
Dan is determined to stay here, no matter what.
No one saw her when she left.
She said she'd pay for everything.
Didn't you know Joe was Emma's husband?
They don't want to come.
Jami said that I seemed anxious.
I'll do whatever you need done.
I don't want to see them today.
I am a photographer.
Who do you support?
Did you say anything to Charlie about that?
It wasn't James's fault.
I couldn't afford to do that.
We want to book a trip to Australia.
He said he wanted to meet you.
What do you think we ought to do?
I told her to go.
Let's try and stay calm, OK?
I should've gotten up earlier this morning.
Are there any other options?
Always keep an open mind.
She has got a lot of weak points.
The pizza's ready.
Muhammad tried to frame Valentina.
I did that almost the same way.
I wouldn't do that either.
Charlie and Valentina say that they weren't here.
Adam is the only professional musician I know.
I have not heard from her recently.
She told me that she wants to die.
Many people like Jami.
You'll have to try one.
Harry is the oldest of Mary's three children.
Maybe the next time you'll listen to me when I tell you to be careful.
Why don't you give it up?
I work hard all the time.
George spent time in Australia.
Margaret is usually very quiet, isn't she?
He'll eat when he gets home.
Our wives went shopping together.
Shame on you.
No one's allowed in here.
Oliver might be in Australia.
Tommy's in a meeting right now.
Muhammad does nothing all day but read.
Neither Alex nor Susie has found anything interesting.
I know that Charlie knows when Emma did that.
Tommy is still tense.
I want to have my car painted dark blue.
It'll be hard to persuade Adam.
There was more bad than good in him.
She can speak English, of course.
You can't hurt me.
They can operate a crane.
I don't mind being beaten by Alex.
How's everything back home?
Alex can cook better than his wife.
Susie is living her dream.
Tommy was last on the list.
No one was hit.
Jami said that he was sick, but that was a lie.
If you wish, everything is yours.
Adam took some pictures of his new house and sent them to his friends.
You've defeated us.
Oliver and I aren't all that different.
Let's not waste this chance.
Would you like to do that now?
There's his bag.
I'll try to persuade Oliver to do that.
Oscar and Laur know that you didn't do that.
It was my idea.
Nobody saw or heard anything.
Alex is slightly under the weather today.
Something has gone terribly wrong.
We're not buying it from you.
Harry went with Lucy to Australia.
An accident may happen at any time.
Hey, look at the snow.
He has no common sense.
He was unable to help her.
You have to do that again.
I can't quite see what's going on.
I knew that William wouldn't have the courage to quit.
Oscar says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
It's hard for me to believe that's going to happen.
Harry says everyone he knows has gone to Australia.
Oliver and Julia said they may do that.
I don't like people standing behind me.
You shouldn't tell anyone about this.
Susie admitted that she was a thief.
You lower it then.
Everyone is planning to do something different.
We'll have a French test on Monday.
I could stay with you.
That's unusual, isn't it?
What's taking him so long?
Are you sure this is what Joe wanted us to buy?
The person standing at the front of the room is a professor in the History Department.
Mary will do whatever you ask her to.
You've got three minutes.
The boys just want to have fun.
I hid in the woods all behind Jami's house.
William asked Lucy if he could kiss her.
Catherine knows she messed up.
Adam took care of them.
He had an assured manner.
What type of work do Alex and Carmen do?
Alex is busy most of the time.
Adam asked Alice to wait for him here.
I saw Oscar doing that in the park yesterday afternoon.
George would be very upset if that happened.
I'll do that some other time.
Dan was to sign the contract in July.
Adam is currently in danger.
Is this water safe to drink?
It's a pity James isn't with us today.
At first sight, he seemed kind and gentle.
I'm doing this for my children.
Are you going to watch the Red Wolf Blood Moon tonight?
I'd love to have it today.
I can deliver it to Muhammad.
We only have simple wants.
I'm sure you're going to enjoy yourself at the party.
A nation does not have to be cruel to be tough.
I know Harry plans on doing that.
Who told James he could join the team?
Jacob was uncomfortable, but Eva wasn't.
We will be taking the same plane.
The boy is nice.
Joe asked Margaret why she didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Jacob would have approved.
Joe doesn't seem to be as sad as Mary seems to be.
Jami didn't think about Lucy.
A woman friend of ours took a trip to a small town last week.
My grandma is a very independent person.
Muhammad and Susie say they'll be more careful from now on.
Jami drank from the tap.
English is spoken by about a billion people.
A new student came into the class.
She has decided that she'll do that.
Jack gave some very sound advice.
Joe should have been the first one to do that.
Oliver isn't as rich as I thought he was.
Don't blame your mistakes on Jack.
Oliver told me that he thought that I should lose some weight.
Alex left a gift for you on your desk.
When did you come to Australia?
Jacob and Carmen told John they wanted to find higher-paying jobs.
Eva fell asleep with her clothes on.
Carmen admitted that she was frightened.
I think William is trying to lose weight.
They told me that they'd lost their watches.
I've already told Monica why she needs to do that.
James and Emma said they're through doing that.
Susie doesn't believe she could do that.
I thought that I'd left it at home.
I thought that Muhammad wasn't as old as I was.
He owns a good few sheep.
I can no longer remain silent.
I think that Jami won't resign.
Is it correct to say it like this?
Did you even know that his name was Alex?
We're going to need all the help we can get.
What kind of job are you looking for?
I wish I could play guitar.
William got married, didn't he?
That's what mothers are for.
Maybe Jami has already done what he was supposed to do.
I know where it came from.
I hope to attend.
Are you really willing to do that?
I need a challenge.
George is invited, too, isn't he?
Where do you think we are?
Carmen let herself in with a key.
I recommend this book.
George said that he was going to go the day before yesterday, but he didn't have time.
I'm really angry with Charlie.
Alex told me he thought that Mary was retired.
I know that Jacob isn't a bad manager.
I saved up my food for later.
I don't think that that's allowed here.
That's my father.
I never sleep in.
Have you ever wondered what might've happened if Oscar hadn't been here?
Ben represents the engine of the story.
I haven't asked a question yet.
Nothing could've prepared Muhammad for what was about to happen.
I'm fed up with all of Muhammad's complaints.
Aren't you having fun?
Alex swore he did not do it more than once.
Don't tell Tommy I did that.
I told Mary that I wanted to go to Boston with her.
This is too expensive!
Oliver and Alice don't know whether they can do that, but they say they'll try.
Guide dogs help blind people.
Not everything can be explained.
Don't believe him. He's just talking to hear himself talk.
I'd be more than happy to help you clean out your garage.
Muhammad and Emma said they didn't plan to go to John's concert.
Is this your homework?
I'll do whatever I can to help you and Oscar.
What have you guys been up too?
Mary is a video artist.
There is no getting along with him.
Do you like San Francisco?
Did Joe talk to you about Lucy?
The game was drawing to an end.
William and Monica's parents aren't going to let them go to Boston with you.
Eva said that she believed that.
He'll do his best to finish the job.
Alex and Catherine didn't want me to go to Boston with them.
I know George might've done that on purpose.
Alex is actually not the manager.
George has made his position clear.
Oscar is on the wagon.
Oliver is really short.
You will not be able to catch the train.
When William woke up, Laur was gone.
Valentina couldn't persuade Tommy to accept her gift.
John isn't my brother; he's my nephew.
Jami told Olivia that she wasn't pouring the beer correctly.
We got something from him.
I worry about whether I'll be a good father.
They say that they'll never leave early.
Adam doesn't know much about tennis.
On hearing the sound, the dog rushed away.
The call is free of charge.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
Every spring brings its lot.
He will return from Europe soon.
James wanted me to go, so I went with him.
James isn't going to be mad if Valentina doesn't do that.
I will be his teacher.
The whole future is just around the corner.
Muhammad and Monica aren't serious, are they?
Do you think that's the answer?
I've asked Charlie to take my place.
Where did you hear that story?
Oliver was determined to exact revenge.
Leave me alone, will you?
Muhammad had one son and two daughters.
Sometimes I understand you.
I don't want to be with you.
I lived in Australia for a long time.
You can help.
I've already finished doing that.
I had no idea you guys were getting married. You should've told me earlier, darn it.
I know that Oliver would show me how to do that if I asked him to.
Why does he hesitate?
Lucy told Oscar that she was innocent.
They claimed that he'd killed her.
Are they together again?
Alice said she wasn't coming.
Alex said that he did it wrong.
That was a bad bet.
I'll probably get in trouble for telling you this, but I don't care.
Alice didn't go because George told her not to.
I'll be right here.
Jack says he thinks it might be expensive to do that.
She said that she had a job for me.
This one's really nice.
I know better than to lie to James.
There, something completely different.
I can't forgive him just because he's a boy.
Jami and Olivia don't often admit they're wrong.
My life is back to normal.
I don't know. It all happened in an instant.
What's your favorite recipe?
I sat together at the counter.
In my heart I always loved you!
What do you need German for?
There are times when I'd like to be more like you.
I thought that James was from Australia.
Anna said she was hoping we could travel together.
We'll finish the work even if it takes us all day.
"I think we shouldn't be doing this." "No one asked you."
Who are you calling fat?
Keep it up, Harry.
I swear you my life that it's true !
Oscar wanted to know why Lucy did that.
"You have got him! Where is he, then?" "He is here." "Here! Where?" "In my company at the present moment."
I like the competition.
Jack let us know that he needs do that.
Charlie is very young and doesn't really understand what's happening.
I thought that you were working.
He would sooner die than get up early every morning.
He was let out after serving just two years of his four-year prison sentence.
I'm using a Mac and I can't read a Windows 95 file.
I think that Jami won't be alone.
This racket is rather too heavy for me.
Don't worry. He knows what he's doing.
Oliver thought that Emma would probably be willing to help.
Oliver doesn't know why I'm here.
They say that Lucy is going to return.
Adam told everyone he was never coming back here.
I'm sure Oscar will be ready.
Don't mothers do that anymore?
George isn't as old as most people think he is.
If you could tell me when Oscar and Emma will arrive, I'll go to the station and pick them up.
Jacob has now agreed not to do that.
Who brought Jack here?
No one can live by and for himself.
I said I'm not going to do that anymore.
Jack was eventually convicted.
What are you doing right now?
Can you guess where I am right now?
I wish we could sing together more often.
He was taken off the team because of his injury.
In my opinion Alex did nothing wrong.
Muhammad knew that I was unlucky.
You've hardly touched your breakfast.
Do you have a dress in white?
What does the dog want?
No cash was missing.
Oscar just got off the phone with Margaret.
His opinions aren't worth listening to.
I wonder whether we're supposed to do that.
Alex and Julia are going to miss doing that.
Why are Alex and Margaret planning to move to Boston?
Almost everyone I know wears contacts.
I'm having lunch with Jacob later.
His business affairs are in good shape.
I want you to live more like a human being.
She ate her salad.
William and Olivia told us that they'd to go with us.
You weren't actually the one who did that, were you?
It took me a long time to convince Tommy to do that.
We need to talk about what needs to be done.
Charlie told me that he thought Laur was mean.
Jack is a simple-minded person.
George and Valentina are the best students in your class, aren't they?
Muhammad and Monica are likely to let John drive.
It'll be hard to do that.
It's a popular fishing spot.
Breakfast will be served.
The meal is good.
Emma said that she didn't want to die.
The doctor told Mary that she couldn't have any more children.
There's no sugar in my tea.
I can recommend this book to you.
My opinion doesn't matter.
You haven't eaten anything.
Oliver assumed that Monica wouldn't be at the party.
The next issue will feature articles on divorce.
Let Alice decide for herself.
We won't take it.
Eva says she's read all of these books.
We're all worried about them.
Tell Jami I can't marry him.
I asked Oliver not to do that here.
Jacob has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Who was writing on the wall?
Don't you have enough shoes?
I am shaking hands with my worst enemy.
Because of the victory, he became a hero.
Do you intend to go swimming today?
Jack is certainly going to do that.
Joe asked me if I was planning on staying.
William is almost ready to leave.
He said he'd do that again.
He is the greatest man in the world.
It was built to last.
My father told me about his experiences during the war.
I have some wonderful news for you.
Muhammad is going to need to wait a while longer.
I know Joe knows why you want Mary to do that.
There is nothing we can do to bring him back.
You said some nice things about me.
You aren't thinking.
You have a ring, don't you?
We'll do everything we can.
They said that they were lonely.
Tommy hasn't been to Australia recently.
The hero is male and white, he comes alone, he doesn't have a family, he never speaks of his family, and his mother died.
James and Catherine didn't want to admit that they were scared.
Jack said that he thinks he can do that.
We're filled for tonight.
Tommy didn't want to make the same mistake as Margaret had.
He is quick to learn.
Jack used to have a big house on Park Street.
They told me they thought I should lose some weight.
Jack was thirty years old when he got married.
I believe that I am one of the most honest politicians in France.
I didn't know it would be so much fun to do that.
It's what I'm used to doing.
He said he'll try to do that.
Enjoy the moment.
Can I sit next to him?
Nobody believes what I say.
This work is not necessarily easy.
I'm happy you're happy.
Thank you for the invitation.
Adam won't likely be forgiven.
You need help, Jacob.
They won't be in time.
This is not an error.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.
I am happy to help.
George and Alice told John they were ready to go.
He passed the examination.
What does Jami want to say to Laur?
I know that Tommy knows that Alice wants to do that.
He had to address the meeting.
I told Oliver I couldn't do that without his help.
Harry and Anna may not want to sing, but you should ask them anyway.
Nobody's allowed to do that.
Joe will eventually give up.
You just left, didn't you?
Maybe we can help her.
I don't want Oscar to help me with my homework.
Oscar has been waiting for ten minutes in the car.
Are you going to the dentist?
His honesty is beyond doubt.
George is at the shopping center, buying supplies.
I want you to know you're forgiven.
Aren't you done with this?
He's known for his sense of humor.
I know you still blame Alex for Mary's death.
"Is this Chinese or Japanese?" "It's Korean."
If only I could sing well.
Tommy says he still has no idea where Catherine is.
I don't think that Adam would be able to do that.
Oscar forgot to pay the electric bill.
Adam thought Carmen was going to kiss him.
A cookie is under the table.
Did I make the team?
I'm really hoping to see Adam.
Finishing the report by tomorrow is next to impossible.
Joe said he won't do that again.
I know Jacob could do that if he needed to.
I know James is a lot smarter now.
I'm planning to stay at a hotel.
I don't think I'm the only one who's worried about what Jacob might do.
He stood behind the chair.
I didn't know that Jami knew why you did that by yourself.
The chicken was a bit dry.
You can borrow my car if you want.
I fail to see the humor in all this.
Oliver didn't say a word all evening.
No matter how fast you run, you won't catch up with him.
We'll be right behind you.
My injuries weren't so serious.
Alex wants to eat with us.
Obviously, Jacob and Emma are very rich.
William has a secret that he's never told anyone.
One should attack ideas with their own weapons: You do not shoot at ideas with a rifle.
There's nothing to be concerned about.
I want to know how much money Joe spent.
I'd like you to assist her.
I know I have to do that today.
Raise your hand if you want to speak.
I had a long talk with them.
I hope I dream about you tonight.
I think we should wait until Oscar and Anna get here.
William always seems to be confident.
I'm not sure William and Anna are willing to help us.
Let's make an appointment.
I'm making a doll for Anna.
Alex came for a visit yesterday.
I forgot to lock the drawer.
Tell Oliver I'm going out for a drive.
She is hungry for affection.
George said he wanted to leave early.
This is a training camp.
I think most people are better off now than they used to be.
It was Earth Day yesterday.
Harry and I stayed quiet.
Sam is serious about his work.
I'm exactly the same height as Alex and Lucy are.
George and Susie are smarter than they look.
Business is good.
Did you hear about what's happened to Joe?
You're cute.
I know it's them.
How far is it to the museum?
Catherine is the next in line, isn't she?
Tommy says Carmen was hungry.
Everybody knows George likes Olivia.
William and Olivia said they don't even want to think about it.
George never talks about what he wants to do in the future.
Is it OK if I call you James?
They wouldn't tell me where they went.
Don't you think Jami might be busy?
Why don't you let us go with you?
Most Japanese live on rice.
Where are they taking her?
Your sister cannot swim well, can she?
It is hard to believe that it actually happened.
How could you let Oliver go?
What do you understand?
As long as it is cheap, any watch will do.
I'm going to see the world.
Why wouldn't you listen?
I'm trying to figure out what I should do.
Adam said Julia could have gotten home by herself.
Let's drink to his success.
You're such a chicken.
He often cries when he's drunk.
I know Oliver and Catherine have a house in Boston.
He fell in love with one of his students.
Charlie and Emma were disappointed, weren't they?
Can't we go now?
His car ran into a tree.
Jami wanted to do that earlier.
Oliver only thinks about making money.
She says she can see ghosts.
Can I have another drink now?
Harry has been given a ticket.
He had something in his hand.
He decided to keep his distance.
The cake has gone bad, no one's going to eat it anymore...
Jami hoped he wouldn't be blamed for what happened.
Do you know anybody who lives in Boston?
William won't be frightened.
I don't think George knows how it happened.
Oscar asked Margaret how to turn off the computer.
You wouldn't do this if Alex and Laur were here.
Oliver said Carmen didn't speak French.
Charlie had a problem with Laur.
Drinking and driving can be dangerous.
When will we drive home?
I wonder whether Jacob is free this afternoon.
I know James could force you to do that.
Valentina didn't know she had to do that.
They looked like they were tired.
In times like this, we should all pull together.
I'm serious about my job.
This idiot of Jacob should have guessed that the last word in this sentence would of course be for Olivia.
I cut off all ties with him.
Even if it rains, he'll play golf.
I hardly ever see you anymore.
Muhammad and Mary say they're going to find out what has to be done.
These are expensive.
I'm pretty certain I haven't made any mistakes.
That is a school.
He bought himself a new sports car.
Something seems to be wrong with this watch.
I didn't want that.
I couldn't stop giggling.
I remember her face, but I don't remember her name.
Even now, we still doubt that he is the real murderer.
Are you sure you aren't cold?
Muhammad said you like to watch horror movies.
Charlie and Olivia told John that they were sleepy.
William said he thought he might need to do that today.
Ask Jack where he is.
I knew Alex wasn't a good driver, but I let him drive anyway.
She thought that her daughter was possessed.
Alex wanted to know the time.
I haven't quite made up my mind.
Joe doesn't want to go to the hospital.
She is too young to know the truth.
I'm more worried about Tommy now.
Do you know James by any chance?
You should tell Tommy not to do that again.
Oscar takes tap dancing lessons twice a week.
You can sleep late tomorrow morning.
Okay, Oscar, that's enough!
Forget I ever said anything.
"Do you like this painting?" "Yes, but I think the frame is more expensive than the picture. Where did you buy it?"
Do you want me to finish it?
Charlie and Susie enjoyed a romantic meal.
Why wasn't I told this before?
He isn't my type.
Muhammad said Susie was too tired to help us today.
I need this one.
How do you think that made Jack and Mary feel?
This movie theater has two floors.
I had an argument with my girlfriend and now she's not talking to me.
He would be paid a small amount of money.
Oscar wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
I thought I heard my name being called.
She looks like an angel.
Tommy refused to show us how to do that.
The king will appear in person tomorrow evening.
They said they'd get there early.
Alex's got a great future.
Jami said he thought that Valentina seemed to be desperate to do that.
I'm not as angry as Oliver is.
Did you get an answer from Muhammad?
Charlie spent long hours in the woods.
Do I really remind you of her?
How much do you charge per hour?
She saw red at that moment.
Tell Alex that I need his help.
Margaret wasted no time.
In my opinion, she's right.
I wish Charlie would come back home.
They said that they felt terrible.
I watched the movie.
I can't get home by myself.
I didn't need to do that, but I did.
It could be a mistake.
Oliver can probably help solve this problem.
I know that I might not have to do that anymore.
Why not come with us?
Almost everyone in the class voted in favor of having a thank-you party for the teachers.
Joe really likes basketball.
I know Jami will try to arrive on time.
Harry is a good chess player.
I still don't know what's going to happen next.
I usually speak French to my teachers.
I'm very surprised that Alex isn't here.
After the work day was over, Harry went home to his wife.
Do you really think that George will be reasonable?
I suspect Oliver is curious.
Joe and Alice didn't have enough money to buy what they needed.
Charlie is doing the laundry.
Are you saying you don't like it?
Mary said she wanted to leave early.
Jami said he was curious.
"How are you doing?" "A little better."
You could have killed me, but you didn't.
I know Adam and Anna used to be good friends.
James hates hot weather.
I know lots of pilots.
You are tired.
I don't think anybody else could do my job.
He is proud that his father was a famous scientist.
See you tomorrow morning!
I hope something good happens before the day is over.
I was born on a ship.
Why don't you come in and we'll talk about it over a cup of coffee.
James and I do a lot of things together.
We've got what we need.
Harry didn't seem to be a nice guy.
I want to make a pie.
This video has already more than a million views.
They told me they thought they could win.
Which do you prefer, coffee or tea?
What's your job here?
Are James and Margaret afraid of that?
George is a really good student.
Had it not been for this error, our team could have won the match.
George won't believe us.
I wish it had been that easy.
Julia said she'd never see me again.
I should know by now that I shouldn't trust Jami.
We don't have enough money to go to Boston by airplane.
Alex will explain why that happened.
Joe will be there to meet you.
Where're the shoes?
The rain turned to snow.
Tommy isn't in his bedroom.
They'll help you do that, won't they?
Your physical condition is crucial.
I have to lose some weight.
Jack is looking forward to getting started.
They said they thought I was cute.
I saw my friend.
Why are you smiling?
You may have it for nothing.
There cannot be any tea left in the pot.
James said that you wanted to go to Australia with us.
I felt something touch my feet.
I know Jami knows I shouldn't be doing that here.
There is no other choice.
Julia was Jacob's first wife.
Whoever may say so, I won't believe.
I really don't sing.
I just made it up.
Joe knocked on the door again.
Have Adam and Susie studied French?
How much did George pay you to help him clean out his garage?
We like to play soccer.
Harry said that he's glad that that you did that.
I think that would be very helpful.
William found an ancient gold coin.
Charlie wanted you to have this.
We almost weren't able to do that.
I'll warn them.
Raise your hand.
Charlie didn't seem to be as relaxed as Alice.
James said that he saw Margaret tonight.
This painting should bring a lot of money at auction.
She has trouble keeping her temper.
My story made the teacher cry.
I'd like to go to Boston with you.
This work calls for a high degree of skill.
She needed help doing her taxes.
Adam was sitting three tables away from us.
We thought you didn't like it.
I said I didn't remember.
I didn't think that Muhammad wanted to do that by himself.
We'd better try and find somewhere safe.
Oscar kept his promise to Olivia.
Fill up the bucket.
I knew that George would be able to do that if you helped him.
I wish Jami were my brother.
Usually, I'll be gone before the morning light.
Adam and Eva were delighted with the result.
I keep having nightmares.
How many sandwiches did Valentina take to school with her?
Let go.
Aren't you sisters?
Muhammad lost his key.
Alex is an industrial engineer.
Alex has finally told the truth.
You must be able to speak French for this job.
Alex, I also want to know what your opinion of this is.
Just what the heck is going on here?
I think you've done this before.
Perhaps you are right.
There is honor even among thieves.
Speaking a foreign language correctly is much harder than understanding one.
Where did we come from?
He's here to protect you.
He said that he was unhappy.
He said that he'd be right over.
I wonder what George and Susie plan to do tomorrow.
That's a nice story.
Jami has never heard Mary tell a lie.
I had to drop Jacob off at school.
She's fixing a car.
If I'd had more money, I'd have bought that pen.
I knew that Charlie would have enough time.
My wife keeps to a strict diet.
Do her parents know she was selected for the program?
Joe asked Emma if he could hold her hand.
Take them to the hospital.
I assume that's a joke.
Wow, that's so cool.
Joe said he thought that Emma wasn't very good at speaking French.
Alex bought everything he needed to buy.
He put his boots back on.
I should have been here yesterday.
Oliver didn't tell Mary he was going to do that.
Careful, don't fall!
The rebels did not only take hostages, but also set the entire village on fire.
I know that James is afraid to walk through the woods alone.
They do everything we tell them.
I need to make another call.
You are boring me!
He should get to your house in an hour.
The idea shocked George.
Oliver put the eggs on a plate.
I thought Tommy could do that for Emma.
I want what you owe me and I want it now.
You're a real pain in the neck.
Don't go to such a place at night.
Jacob didn't tell Carmen he was sleepy.
Alex and Alice knew that they weren't going to have any fun.
I'm sorry, George. I just can't do it.
Do you think it would be safe to do that?
You can't be too careful when crossing the street.
They said they love that kind of work.
George told everyone that he was fine.
I'll be watching you.
You must listen to me.
I still think it's funny.
Why do I have to help?
Don't tell her I said that.
We worked like so many ants.
Some questions were asked me by the teacher.
I doubt very seriously Harry will be up at this time of night.
She has finished her work.
Father and I go fishing once in a while.
Joe won't ask you to work late.
He has a son.
I'm here with a friend.
Maybe that would work.
An excellent man: he has no enemies, and none of his friends like him.
You can invite anyone you want.
Tell me which bus I should take.
I hope Harry doesn't lose his voice.
Joe works at the largest department store in town.
Say hello to Jimmy.
Goodbye, cruel world.
Muhammad and Emma say they didn't know John was going to have to do that next week.
I think I've got a better idea.
Charlie has stopped crying.
Many books were forgotten.
Joe accepted an expensive gift from Alice.
Alex is much surprised at the news.
I usually go to bed before ten.
It's thanks to you.
William and Lucy say they need to find someone to do that for them.
Neither Harry nor Laur has been suspended from the team.
Jami checked Olivia's pulse to see whether she was alive or not.
Can you please come fix this?
I'm doing what's necessary.
George told Julia that he'd eat anything she made for him.
My bucket is full.
Jacob rescued the cat from the flames.
Jacob let the cat out of the bag when he accidentally told his mother about the surprise party being planned for her.
"I saw Charlie today." "Who?!"
You can't fire him.
Father has now got a superior position in his office.
At least I wasn't alone.
I know Jami isn't a very bright kid.
Muhammad has to agree.
I think that Adam may come to Boston for Thanksgiving.
I don't think that you ought to do that here.
I want to go to the moon.
I bought one.
He has got it.
I want you to drive me to school.
We deserve this.
He's going to his room.
I want to eat something nice.
William thought Catherine would be first.
Muhammad assured Monica that he wouldn't be late for the party.
Kick! Kick!
I have read your book. It's very interesting.
George goes to his parents' house every weekend.
James was invited to Australia by Alice.
Didn't you know that Alex wanted to do that?
Oliver isn't really happy here.
Doesn't that sound like something Muhammad would say?
Another patient has died.
James walked into the house carrying a box full of old clothes.
There was a cool wind.
Please don't cry any more.
Don't trust him, no matter what he says.
Adam is good at driving.
I know Harry will be doing that again today.
Where did she stay last night?
I admitted that Jack and Lucy were right.
I can't wait for Muhammad any longer.
Mr. Smith is a candidate for mayor.
Israel has the right to "defend" itself including by killing children in their homes with chemical weapons.
He never gave up on himself.
We might get arrested if we do that.
He told me he didn't cry.
Jacob is quite selfish.
Is that a scientific fact?
Jacob admitted he murdered Valentina.
William said that he wouldn't want to do that.
Muhammad's very hard-working.
You don't think Alex can do that, do you?
I think it's dangerous to swim in this river.
I'm not going to go in there.
They never admitted that they were wrong.
Charlie and Lucy said they won't be allowed to do that anymore.
Are you and your sister close?
I have to go find James.
James is fine today.
Tommy wouldn't even discuss it.
William isn't very happy, is he?
I lost weight last winter.
Tell me everything that William told you.
The country needs your help.
I'd like to thank you for everything you've done.
I got very angry with Oliver.
I want Charlie to know that.
It's expensive.
They promised me they'd do it.
Joe will come back to get Julia.
What do you need me to explain?
Adam only does what I tell him to do.
Carmen is quite angry, isn't she?
I would vote for that.
They've denied they cheated.
We all consider it wrong to cheat in exams.
Tell Jack I need to get home before 2:30.
I'd be embarrassed to do that here.
She lost her son in the war.
Remember to check to make sure the gas has been turned off before you go out.
William and Catherine aren't likely to cry, are they?
Lucy claims she was drunk at the time.
Listening to this song makes me want to dance.
This plan is being discussed right now.
Why do I have to dress up?
Take off your socks, please.
Please do so.
French is spoken in Switzerland.
Adam said he thought Julia was having fun.
I expected Tommy to go swimming with us yesterday.
Don't waste your time.
Laur drew me a map to her house.
What public equipment is there?
Not until yesterday did I know the truth.
Carmen told me she didn't know why Tommy had left.
Adam has done something bad.
Will you be long?
Tommy kept his true feelings hidden from everyone.
Muhammad and Susie haven't finished eating yet.
I'm here to help in any way I can.
It's now your turn.
I'm glad someone told me.
We can tell you're not a bad guy, Oliver.
How many years has Oliver been doing that?
This is a fact, not a fiction.
There's somebody who wants to meet you.
My family's not rich.
Have had it.
We can do this together.
She's more powerful than you.
Joe has told me he'll do that tomorrow.
James and Mary said that they'd be happy to do that.
I have someplace to go.
Did you shave this morning?
My car's parked out front.
Can you remember anything at all about that?
Jacob should've won.
Jacob is back in the hospital.
I don't know this song.
I don't see what you're so concerned about.
Joe realized he ought to do that.
It doesn't help.
It's a special time for us.
The people gathered about us.
He discovered a new star.
He'll laugh when he sees this.
It doesn't have to be that complicated.
I've written the letter already.
James held out his hand to Lucy.
They promised they'd do that tomorrow.
You really should've gone to Australia last summer.
I need to know that William and Carmen are happy.
I think that this is right.
I should've been able to handle Adam.
William was wearing a green jacket.
William has been blamed for what happened.
I know Jacob and Anna aren't telling the truth.
Each way of sleeping is likely to produce a different kind of adult.
Is there a post office near here?
Charlie looks very sleepy.
It could be exciting.
Mice carry the plague.
We help Jack in a lot of ways.
Has Oscar ever been married?
My boyfriend still hasn't been to the Great Wall.
Jacob said that he wasn't ready to become a father.
You might as well leave.
They were badly in need of water.
I sat down on the couch next to her.
Both of us could have died.
Shit! You scared me half to death!
I wrote to them.
I wonder why Alex and Susie are so exhausted.
We met her here.
Where have you been, young lady?
Alex said that Emma knew he wanted to do that again.
I want you more than I've ever wanted anyone else.
Oliver and I aren't alone.
Charlie didn't win the race, ruining his perfect record.
That won't have an effect.
I wish Charlie wouldn't keep telling everyone I'm his brother.
I'm concerned about Jack.
She bought three new picks.
Jacob was looking up at the ceiling.
I like playing golf.
Have you been back to Boston since you graduated?
Alex always seems to be happy.
Let's find out what Jack thinks.
Carmen is going to be really tired when she gets home, isn't she?
Report the sick!
That's all past now.
Margaret claimed she did that.
Muhammad asked Carmen to help him.
In fact, it's a mistake.
I'll tell him myself.
How are we going to get past the alarm system?
How long should we leave it in the oven?
George is expected to make a full recovery.
William suggested that you might enjoy going to the zoo with us.
I didn't know William and Mary were planning to do that today.
We're the only ones here who know that Joe already knows why Laur didn't do that.
Read this when you have time.
How did I get into this?
Jami thought that no one was at home.
Would you excuse me for a sec?
The leaves fell from the trees.
I hope you'll soon get well.
I have to pull over for a minute.
William and Catherine told John they wouldn't eat the stew if it had pork in it.
I usually take a bath after dinner.
Nothing's going on.
Peter reads a book.
Jacob has been to Boston, hasn't he?
You'd do the same for me.
Please let the man talk.
They're very good with their hands.
I don't have enough money to buy everything I want.
Why are Tommy and Catherine still doing that?
I shouldn't have accused him of stealing the money.
Jacob took the morning off.
